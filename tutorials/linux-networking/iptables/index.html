<h1>Intro</h1>
<ul>
<li><code>iptables</code> is a command line application for linux to interact with kernel level <strong>netfilter</strong>.</li>
<li>It works on those linux system having that <em>netfilter framework</em>.</li>
<li><code>iptables</code> adds, deletes or modifies entries in the kernel filtering table.</li>
<li>As, it directly interacts with kernel, each time you reboot or shutdown your machine, all the rules you added will be flushed.</li>
<li>You can use <code>iptables-persistence</code> aka <code>netfilter-persistence</code> to maintain the rules reloaded in every session of your login.</li>
<li>Default ACCEPT or DROP of packet is generally decided by the default policy of the chain. </li>
<li>In short, it is a way to decide the <em>fate of every packet</em> that comes in or goes out of the machine.</li>
<li>Man Page : <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables">man iptables</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Tables</h2>
<p><strong>RAW, MANGLE, NAT, FILTER</strong> are the main tables for <code>iptables</code>. Every tables are specified for some special task.  It is better (must for beginners) to use tables as per their characteristic or only for the purpose they are designed.</p>
<h3>RAW</h3>
<ul>
<li>Default chains in this table are : <em>PREROUTING, OUTPUT</em></li>
<li>Mainly use to est a mark on packets that they should not be handled by the <a href="https://www.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial/iptables-tutorial.html#STATEMACHINE">connection-tracking-system</a>. This is because <strong>RAW</strong> table is hit before any connectio is tracked.</li>
<li>This is done by using <code>NOTRACK</code> target on the packet.</li>
</ul>
<h3>MANGLE</h3>
<ul>
<li>Default chains in this table are : <em>PREROUTING, INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT, POSTROUTING</em></li>
<li>Mainly used for mangling packets or to mangle targets.</li>
<li>Actually the use case is mostly to change :<ol>
<li>TOS</li>
<li>TTL</li>
<li>MARK</li>
<li>SECMARK</li>
<li>CONNSECMARK</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>More on these : <a href="https://www.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial/iptables-tutorial.html#MANGLETABLE">Mangle-Targets</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>NAT</h3>
<ul>
<li>Default chains in this table are : <em>PREROUTING, INPUT, OUTPUT, POSTROUTING</em></li>
<li>This should only be use when you will need to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">Network Address Translation</a></li>
<li>Following are the main targets used in this table :<ol>
<li>DNAT</li>
<li>SNAT</li>
<li>MASQUERADE</li>
<li>REDIRECT</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>More on these : <a href="https://www.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial/iptables-tutorial.html#NATTABLE">Nat-Targets</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>FILTER</h3>
<ul>
<li>Default chains in this table are : <em>INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT</em></li>
<li>This is where all the filtering related packets are perfomed.</li>
<li>Mainly packets are either <em>accepted</em>(ACCEPT) or <em>dropped</em>(DROP)</li>
</ul>
<h2>User Defined Chains</h2>
<ul>
<li>Users themselves can define their chain for custom ruleset.</li>
<li>This chain is nothing but the collection of rules.</li>
<li>When a packet matches a rule whose target is a user-defined chain, the packet begins traversing the rules in that user-defined chain. If that chain doesn't decide the fate of the packet, then once traversal on that chain has finished, traversal resumes on the next rule in the current chain.</li>
<li>This figure illustrate the traversal :</li>
</ul>

<h2>Packet Traversal</h2>
<p>When a packet first enters the firewall, it hits the hardware and then gets passed on to the proper device driver in the kernel. Then the packet starts to go through a series of steps in the kernel, before it is either sent to the correct application (locally), or forwarded to another host - or whatever happens to it.</p>

<p>The Figure below can summerize these all tables :</p>
<p><img src="/temp/pics/iptables_traverse.jpg" alt="iptables_traverse.jpg"></p>
<h2>Playing with <code>iptables</code></h2>
<h3>Basic Operations on Chain</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create Chain ( <code>-N</code> )</li>
<li>Delete Empty Chain ( <code>-X</code> )</li>
<li>Change Policy ( <code>-P</code> ) </li>
<li>List Rules ( <code>-L</code> ) </li>
<li>List Rules for particular table ( <code>-L -t &lt;table&gt;</code> )</li>
<li>List Rules in different Format ( <code>-n -L</code> )</li>
<li>List Rules with line numbers ( <code>-n -L --line-number</code> )</li>
<li>Flush the Rules out of chain ( <code>-F</code> )</li>
<li>Zero the packet and byte counters on all rules in the chain ( <code>-Z</code> )</li>
</ul>
<h3>Manipulation on Table</h3>
<ul>
<li>Append new rule in chain ( <code>-A</code> )</li>
<li>Insert new rule at some position ( <code>-I &lt;chain&gt; &lt;rule-num&gt;</code> )</li>
<li>Replace new rule at some position ( <code>-R &lt;chain&gt; &lt;rule-num&gt;</code> )</li>
<li>Delete new rule at some position or Delete the first that matches ( <code>-D &lt;chain&gt; &lt;rule-num&gt;</code> ) </li>
</ul>
<h3>Filtering</h3>
<ul>
<li>Source or Destination IP Address ( <code>--src</code>, <code>--dst</code> )</li>
<li>Protocol ( `--protocol <num|name> )</li>
<li>Interface ( <code>--in-interface</code>, <code>--out-interface</code> )</li>
<li>You can specify interface that does not exist or that is <em>DOWN</em>, but rule will only match when the interface is availabe and <em>UP</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Extentions</h3>
<ul>
<li>When you specify protocol with  <code>-p</code> or <code>--protocol</code>, the modules related protocol are loaded from the kernel. The load depends on the protocol you specify.</li>
<li>If you wanna load external module which should be installed in you system, you can load it with the help of <code>-m</code> or <code>--match</code>.</li>
<li><strong>mac</strong> extention provides <code>--mac-source &lt;mac&gt;</code> option which you can use in <em>INPUT, FORWARD, PREROUTING</em> chains. </li>
<li><strong>limit</strong> extention provides <code>--limit {N[/s|m|h|d]</code> with <code>--limit-burst &lt;N&gt;</code> whcih you can use to set limit and burst limit in the specific match of packets.</li>
<li><strong>state</strong> extention is very useful on designing filtering rules. This extention provides <code>--state {NEW | ESTABLISHED | RELATED | INVALID}</code> for packet filtering based on <a href="https://www.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial/iptables-tutorial.html#STATEMACHINE">state</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic Rule</h2>
<p>Each packet in the table is actually defined as :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If packet looks like this, Perform this action for this packet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following can be the basic ruleset or filewall :</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Allow all outgoing traffic
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

# Block all incoming traffic by default
iptables -P INPUT DROP

# Allow incoming traffic on loopback interface
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

# Allow incoming traffic on established and related connections
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

# Allow SSH incoming traffic
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

# Allow HTTP and HTTPS incoming traffic
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

# Allow DNS incoming traffic
iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT

# Drop all other incoming traffic
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP

# Save the rules
iptables-save &gt; /etc/iptables/rules.v4
</code></pre>
