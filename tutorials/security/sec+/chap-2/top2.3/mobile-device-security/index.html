<h1>Mobile Devices Security</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Challenging to secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relatively small and could be hidden anywhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frequent connection to internet means more large attack vector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Packed with personal and organizational sensitive data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Jailbreaking/Rooting</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These mobile devices tends to have a lot of security policies built in to their system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One way of circumventing this is to <strong>jainbreak or root</strong> the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don't commonly have access to these devices at <strong>kernal or OS level</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a complex OS running under the hood and there had been instances where attackers were able to gain access to <strong>OS level</strong> and perform anything they want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can even replace with your own OS if you manage to have <em>jailbreaking/rooting</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They actually replace firmware of the system with the third party software in order to <em>jailbreak or root</em> their device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is done actually to install more additional features that won't be found normally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of the security policies placed by <strong>Mobile Device Manager</strong> will be circumvented.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sideloading</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Normally organization or OS itself will restrict you to download only from <em>Global or local app store</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But if you happen to <em>jailbreak/root</em>, the device you can download from anywhere and hence referred as <em>Sideloading</em>, and there could be malicious software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again your MDM will be relatively useless.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
