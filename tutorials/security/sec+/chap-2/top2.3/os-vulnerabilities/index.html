<h1>Operating System Vulnerabilities</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>OS itself could have vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is normal as they consist of millions of lines of code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microsoft releases patches every 2nd tuesday of month known as patch tuesday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When these are realease, security department research and test and ultimately approve for deployment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Should you update ?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>YES</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using home pc, just perform backup and update.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If  you are in company, you first go through testing process and then ultimately backup and update.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is always race between you and attackers and the update window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If attacker is able to write and deploy code against those vulnerabilities before you have been patch, you will likely be attacked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If update requires reboot, make sure to save all data.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
