<h1>Memory Injections</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All the software to be able to run should load from disk to memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once they are in memory they will have their own process to run or inject itself on another process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If injected in another process, it will past from <em>process based firewall or detection</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The software/malware will have same privilege as of process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scope of Memory based injections</h2>
<ul>
<li>Process</li>
<li>DLLs</li>
<li>Buffers</li>
<li>Threads</li>
<li>Memory Mgt Functions</li>
</ul>
<h3>DLLs</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Windows library containing code and data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type of software or application that many different processes/apps can use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attacker install DLL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attacker find process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attacker will want DLLs to run as a part of that process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attacker wil place path to DLL on that process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As process is running, when it moves to the point where it needs to access or derefernce that DLL address, it will go to that location/address and load into the process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now Attacker could run many other apps as part of that DLL</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
