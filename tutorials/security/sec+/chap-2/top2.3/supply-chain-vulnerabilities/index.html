<h1>Supply Chain Vulnerabilities</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chain of **Raw Materials -&gt; Supplier -&gt; Manufacturor -&gt; Distributor -&gt; Customer (we)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One exploit in this chain can fully damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generally we trust supplier so we don't take this in central issue, when new system or device is being delivered.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Service Providers</h2>
<p>When you are managing your systems on you own, you know exact security posture but what if your Network, Devices, Administration etc. is managed by the 3rd party Service Provider ? Obviously you trust them in first place to give them access, but this must be restrictive.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Service Provider should be responsible for all security concerns in the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Attacker could gain access to the service provider, they will now have all your data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, it is must to <em>perform security audit</em> with these 3rd party provides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Aduit</em> is related to <em>Hey what are the procedures you are applying to manage and secure our data/system ?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must be familier with this chain in the 3rd party provider.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hardware Providers</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shoud you trust your hardware providers ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit your trust to some vendors in the market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policies and Procedures for aquisition and implementation of these hardware .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test before deploying even if you are using vendor specifc hardware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is important because, you have have been provided <em>Counterfited Hardware</em> i.e just looking similar but different configuration or OS running inside.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
