<h1>Different Malware Types</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyloggers</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Clipboard loging</li>
<li>Screen logging</li>
<li>Instant Messaging</li>
<li>Search Engine Data/Queries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logic Bomb</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Waits for the even to execute the bomb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It works similar like <code>cron</code> job or <code>task scheduler</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event could be particular date, task, login, browser open etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Difficult to detect coz they usually don't contain malware or virus signature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You could deploy monitoring tools for your files and frequenty check if the sensitive files are modified, or may restrict the permission to those files or data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even monitor scheduled task so that you could know if they are pointing to something sensitive or something you didn't install or create.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rootkits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hides itself inside of the kernal of OS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once inside the kernel level access, it could perform whatever,even greater privilege than of superuser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is part of kernel, it is a lot hard to identify by traditional antivirus because they generally won't have root level access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When rootkit is running, it is running as part of OS. You might not find it inside the task viewer or task manager or process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, we can give kernel level permission to such softwares but some code error or bug onto these system could crash the whole system. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike-related_IT_outages#Outage">CrowdStrike Outage</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you know you have been infected you can use several rootkit removal tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Boot</strong> will look for OS signature and confirm that nothing has been changed to the kernel of the system before the system boots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will prevent rootkit from running as signature has been changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, always <em>enable</em> or just don't just <em>disable</em> this feature unless you know what you are doing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
