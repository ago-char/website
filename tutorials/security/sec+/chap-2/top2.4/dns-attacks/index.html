<h1>DNS Poisoning</h1>
<h2>Modifying DNS Server</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Well only possible if attacker has gain access to DNS server computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attacker will modify and probably redirect to his own set up computer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Modifying Host File</h2>
<ul>
<li>First of all if browser doesnot have cache, it will look up into <code>/etc/hosts</code> file to resolve DNS name and if attacker modifies info in that file, whenever user requested particular web page they will be presented as attacker webpage.html</li>
</ul>
<h2>Domain Hijacking</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Gaining Access to Domain Resgistrar and modifying records to point to attacker IP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This can be sophisticated because, records in DNS servers will auto be modified because once you update in registrarer, server will trust that registrar and will update record.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>URL Hijacking / Typosquatting / Brandjacking</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attacker will have similar domain name as to of particular target organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now what he could do is to redirect the traffic to different website where he will earn Ads revenue from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attacker could also redirect traffic to competitor of the target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attacker could even sell the domain name to the competitor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attacker may perform auto download or drive-by download.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attacker my present a phishing site.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
