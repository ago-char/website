<h1>Denial of Service</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attacker overloading the server, so that no one can gain access. For eg: </p>
<ul>
<li>you may have 10 Ip address for dynamic purpose and if all requested by attacker with DHCP attack, he will have it all and other won't be able to access</li>
<li>Server may have implemented 'N' user policy and attacker logging in with all 'N' no. of users could prevent other legitimate user from accessing service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>DoS can be perform taking advantage of existing vulnerability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This may  be planned by your competitor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This may be a distraction as attacker is keeping you on illusion and attacking other system hardly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removal of Power is a funny example of DoS, as this is not software based.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>You may be the cause of DoS</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Downloading a large file without bandwidth bound i.e. the file will take the entire bandwidth and you will not be able to perform regular activity normally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may connect 2 switches together and form a loop if you are not using STP.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Distrubuted DoS (DDoS)</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There will be series or collection of computer to perform DDoS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are often been compromised for this purpose</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A central device (attacker) will compromise many devices around the world and the infected devices i.e commonly referred as <em>botnets</em> perfoms anything they receive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attacker will send DDoS request to <em>botnets</em> and they will do exactly the same</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They tend to send exact high amount of information from very few request and data :</p>
<ul>
<li>For eg: replies of DNS, NTP, ICMP are in very large mount as compared to the requested data size</li>
<li>They may spoof target ip and request in behalf of target IP and the requested data, instead of own end will be sent to target automatically by the requested server</li>
<li>Obviously this type of attack can be more easy if there is vulnerable target</li>
<li>If the target is configured not to receive what they never asked for, this won't be success</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Configuration should be updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Up to date servers be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stateful firewalls be used i.e defing the firewall rules according to state for eg: receive ACK only if SYN is sent, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
