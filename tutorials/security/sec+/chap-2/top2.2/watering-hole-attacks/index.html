<h1>Watering Hole Attacks</h1>
<p>This is the situation where your company is fully secure and all are trained not to fall in any types of attack. Maybe the attacker has failed in trying internal attack, so now he will try to attack the system that he knows your company will often visit and has high probability of accessing later on.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attacking that third party so that they can attack you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Posision whole water, but you are the target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you are attacked, they may only target you means the service may be normal for other users of that 3rd party but you may be receiving malicious code/emails/software or even DoS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to prevent ?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use layered defense or multi layer security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if they are through (port / firewall), your IDS should detect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they are through your IDS, your IPS should prevent the intrusion.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
