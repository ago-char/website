<h1>PENTEST</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Goes one step further than vulnerability scanning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal is to actively <strong>exploit</strong> the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organizations may task seasonal, regular, or irregular pentests by third parties to ensure systems remain secure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rules of Engagement</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>document</strong> that outlines the scope and purpose of the pentest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensures everyone is aware of the test parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This can involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Physical pentests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Internal or external pentests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing during office hours, off-hours, or specific times (e.g., after 4 PM).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rules should specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IP ranges to target and avoid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Systems to test and systems to ignore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedures to follow if a production system crashes during testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emergency contact details or protocols when issues arise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to handle sensitive information extracted during the test.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>After You Exploit</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After gaining access, <strong>lateral movement</strong> should be attempted to move between systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to <strong>elevate privileges</strong> to gain more control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once inside, it’s relatively easy to access more systems, as firewalls may allow connections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DMZ Zone Access</strong>: If you're placed in the DMZ zone with limited access, use any compromised system as a pivot point.</p>
<ul>
<li>This could be configured as a proxy or relay to move further into the network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Persistence</strong>: Don't assume the vulnerability or password you exploited will last forever.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install backdoors, create user accounts, set up SSH (or similar technologies), and change default passwords to maintain access.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Responsible Disclosure Program</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not all vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed immediately upon discovery.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is because it takes time to develop a patch, test it, and release it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When researchers discover vulnerabilities, they inform the developer or manufacturer.</p>
<ul>
<li>The developer writes a patch, which is tested and released along with a <strong>CVE</strong> (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) ID to assist other researchers and organizations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This process is often incentivized through <strong>bug bounties</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most researchers do not work for free—if they do, they are likely hackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hackers</strong> do not disclose their findings but instead exploit them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developers often launch bug bounty programs and partner with platforms like <strong>HackerOne</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Interested researchers can participate, and if they exploit the vulnerability, they are rewarded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, they must sign an agreement that prevents them from publicly discussing or mentioning the vulnerability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></div>
