<h1>Vulnerability Remediation</h1>
<h2>Patching</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The primary method of addressing a discovered vulnerability is <strong>patching</strong> the system to bring it up to date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patches are typically released on a regular basis, such as monthly or semi-annually, by companies or manufacturers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a patch isn't available, you may need to consult the community or the vendor for advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zero-day vulnerabilities</strong> are particularly challenging since there's no scheduled patch, and the system may already be affected. In such cases, mitigation strategies such as isolating the affected system or detaching it from critical infrastructure may be necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ongoing Process</strong>: Patching is an ongoing effort, as vulnerabilities are constantly discovered, and patches are released. Continuous testing and deployment in production environments are required to keep the system secure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cybersecurity Insurance</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity Insurance</strong> can help cover financial losses from risks such as data breaches, ransomware, phishing, and privacy violations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may cover costs associated with data recovery, lost revenue, and other cybersecurity-related incidents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, <strong>cybersecurity insurance</strong> does not cover all situations. For example, intentional acts like fraud, fund transfers, or criminal activities may not be covered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's essential to read the insurance policy carefully and select a flexible plan that fits your organization's needs, especially if you face significant threats like ransomware.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Segmentation</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Segmentation</strong> can be implemented physically (using separate switches) or logically (via VLANs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While segmentation does not directly mitigate vulnerabilities, it prevents attackers from easily pivoting between systems. For example, if <strong>SystemA</strong> in <strong>Segment1</strong> is exploited, segmentation ensures that the attacker cannot access systems in <strong>Segment2</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)</strong> can be used to control traffic between segments, providing additional monitoring, logging, and report generation capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If patching is not possible, creating an <strong>air gap</strong> (disconnecting from the internet) is another method to protect the system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compensating Controls</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If patching is not immediately feasible due to various reasons, compensating controls can be implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Disable the problematic service</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revoke access</strong> to the affected application or service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limit user access</strong> or restrict external access to the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modify <strong>Access Control Lists (ACLs)</strong> and <strong>firewall settings</strong> to minimize potential attack vectors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rules, Exceptions, Exemptions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rule</strong>: Patching is generally the best solution for vulnerabilities, but there may be <strong>exceptions</strong> or <strong>exemptions</strong> based on non-technical reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Exception</strong>: For instance, in some cases, additional security measures like strengthening ACLs, firewalls, or other controls might be an appropriate response instead of patching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exemption</strong>: In special cases, a system might not be patched at all. For example, a <strong>lab system</strong> might be exempt from patching if it is not connected to critical infrastructure, whereas a <strong>data center</strong> system with strong physical security might have an exception to not immediately patch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Validation of Remediation</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After applying patches, you must ensure that the remediation is effective and that no vulnerabilities remain.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rescanning</strong> the system can help validate that vulnerabilities have been addressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manual Testing</strong>: It's important to test manually, especially in complex environments. This could include logging into systems, conducting manual attacks, or checking for false positives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reporting</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Manual checks</strong> on hundreds of systems can be time-consuming, tedious, and not scalable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once remediation is complete, <strong>reporting</strong> is essential to provide an overview of the security posture. This report should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The number of vulnerable systems identified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comparison between patched and unpatched systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New threat notifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Errors, exceptions, and exemptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overall status of vulnerability management efforts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></div>
