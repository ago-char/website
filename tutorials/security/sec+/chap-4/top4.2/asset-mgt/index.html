<h1>Asset Management</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A formal process is followed for purchasing goods from third parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It requires approval and signatures from different departments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An end user typically initiates the request, which goes to the purchasing department and ultimately to the management team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negotiations with suppliers involve pricing, licensing, terms, and contracts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payments may be made upon delivery or after use, depending on the agreed terms and invoice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accounting</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tangible goods are added to the Central Asset Tracking System.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, when someone receives a laptop, the ownership is registered in their name; you can also update or modify details if needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assets are classified based on type—hardware or software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This classification helps in financial accounting. For instance, hardware may be treated as a capital expenditure (CapEx), while software may be categorized as an operating expenditure (OpEx).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Asset Tracking</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maintaining an inventory of assets helps in tracking their physical location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It helps you identify where the device is—whether it's a building, room number, tag, or assigned employee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asset tracking can be part of enumeration. For example, a switch may include connected cables, extended ports, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devices may be tagged using RFID, barcodes, organization names, or other identification methods. Some important devices even use GPS or location tracking systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reuse of Devices / Media Sanitization</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reusing devices can be challenging, especially if they have storage media attached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is mainly due to data sensitivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of data destruction may differ depending on the use case:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are giving it to a recycling team (including the hard drive), you should fully wipe or destroy the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always consider backing up first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same precautions apply if you're selling or handing over the device to someone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In internal transfers, sensitive files may need deletion or the drive may be replaced altogether.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use secure data wiping tools and ensure no data can be recovered afterward.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Complete Destruction</h2>

<li>
<p>Hammering is a fast way for destroying a few drives – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cruJDmMMHLM">Check this out</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fire can also destroy the drive – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZnyJSqUL0w">See this</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once a hole is drilled through the center of the platter, the data becomes irrecoverable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Certificate of Destruction</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Organizations often have thousands of devices and drives to destroy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They might lack time, resources, or an internal department for hardware destruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, they partner with third-party vendors that specialize in this task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These vendors not only destroy the drives but also provide a <strong>Certificate of Destruction</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once certified, you can be confident the data is no longer accessible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Before initiating destruction, always ensure proper data backup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Different types of data require different backup methods—full, partial, or incremental.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backup formats may vary: physical ledgers, computer files, drives, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retention policies must be followed carefully.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Example: Your organization may have a policy to retain emails for two years. Even if they appear outdated, they cannot be deleted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emails may be retrieved from drives in real-time if hosted locally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial or manual records may need to be kept in paper form (contracts, sales records, etc.) for extended periods.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></div>
