<h2>URL Scanning/Filtering</h2>

<h2>Agent Based</h2>
<p>Firewalls assumes that the device will be on site, but this is not always case in our moving world, the devices are moving. So, developers comes with the solution of <em>Agent Based URL Filters</em> so that, as it is installed on Host, it does not require external firewall. Yes they are managed from central console but the rules will be applied to device basis or maybe same to all. This provide both granular and central control.</p>
<p>The rules should be latest and greatest and should be distributed to all agents. The idea is always similar, if it is built in to firewall or agent or other. There will be certain kind of rules to allow or deny.</p>

<h3>Reputation Based Rules</h3>

<h2>DNS Filtering</h2>
<p>This is very low level stuff i.e. if you set rules not to resolve domain names to ip address for certain sites or domain names then you have no other way to visit that web site or access certain content. DNS can work on real time i.e. when you request resources, so unless, spooffed they are up to date. Also records are synced in matter of minutes.</p>
