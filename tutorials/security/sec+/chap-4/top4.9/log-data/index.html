<h1>Log Data</h1>
<h2>Security Log Files</h2>
<p>We store a massive amount of security-related information in log files contained in servers, devices, and other components on our network. These log files contain information such as the traffic flows that were blocked and the traffic flows that were allowed. We can obtain a list of exploit attempts, especially from intrusion prevention devices. We might want to see what categories of URLs are being blocked on a particular user's workstation, and we can analyze traffic data, which could indicate some type of malicious process occurring within our network.</p>
<p>This allows us to document every traffic flow on the network and provide information on what attacks may be occurring. Additionally, we can correlate that information with other logs contained in different devices to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the security event.</p>
<h2>Firewall Logs</h2>
<p>One of the devices that contains a significant amount of detail about the traffic on our network is the firewall log. Our firewalls often monitor all traffic that goes from the inside to the outside of our network and vice versa. From this, we can obtain information about the source and destination IP addresses associated with those traffic flows. We can see what port numbers are being used, and we can observe what the firewall does with those traffic flows—whether the firewall allows the traffic flow to proceed or blocks it.</p>
<p>If you're using a next-generation firewall (NGFW), you can also get information about the applications that are in use. These NGFWs are also highly effective at providing feedback on URLs or URL categories that are being used, and they may be able to point out suspicious data or anomalies within the traffic flows.</p>
<h2>Application Logs</h2>
<p>The applications that we use can also generate log files that are highly useful when analyzing security events. This might include information from the Windows Event Viewer, specifically the Application Log section. For Linux or macOS, you can look in the <code>/var/log</code> directory. All of this information is typically aggregated into a single Security Information and Event Manager (SIEM), where the logs can be filtered or viewed in various ways within the SIEM itself.</p>
<h2>Endpoint Devices Logs</h2>
<p>Endpoint devices also contain a significant amount of log data. Whether you're using a laptop, desktop, phone, tablet, or any other endpoint device, there's extensive log information available. For example, you may be able to view details about login and logout events, system events, or processes running on the endpoint. Information on device management, such as password changes or lockouts, may also be available. Additionally, you can view data on directory services.</p>
<p>All of this endpoint log information can be consolidated into a SIEM (Security Information and Event Manager), allowing you to parse and analyze the data. This enables you to correlate what's happening on the endpoint with network activity and logs from other devices. By consolidating these logs into a single source within the SIEM, you can track each step of a traffic flow or potential security event and perform a more comprehensive analysis.</p>
<h2>OS-specific Security Logs</h2>
<p>Operating systems also store extensive security information. Many operating systems maintain log files associated with security events, which allow you to monitor individual applications, detect brute-force attacks, track changes to critical system files, and log authentication-related events. These security logs can provide early warnings about potential security incidents.</p>
<p>For example, a log file might show that a particular service was disabled, which may not be something an administrator would normally do. This log entry could trigger a security alert, enabling you to respond before a security breach occurs. Given the vast amount of data collected across all systems, it may not be practical to send all log information to the SIEM. Instead, it's often more efficient to only forward the information that's necessary to make informed security decisions.</p>
<h2>IDS/IPS Logs</h2>
<p>Another valuable source of information is IPS or IDS events, which are associated with intrusion prevention or intrusion detection systems. Nowadays, these functionalities are often integrated into next-generation firewalls instead of using standalone IPS or IDS systems. An IDS log provides details about known vulnerabilities or attack patterns. </p>
<p><img src="/pics/snort-log.png" alt="snort-log.png"></p>
<p>For example, a log from an open-source IPS like Snort might include a timestamp, the alert class (such as a possible denial of service attack, specifically a SYN flood attack), the priority level of the alert, source and destination IP addresses, and port numbers.</p>
<p>By collecting these individual events, we can roll them up into a SIEM, enabling us to correlate this data with other devices on the network and gain better insight into potential security incidents.</p>
<h2>Network Logs</h2>
<p>We can also gather a significant amount of log information from our network infrastructure devices, such as switches, routers, wireless access points, and even VPN concentrators. These log files can reveal changes to routing tables, authentication errors when someone attempts to access a switch or router, and other types of network attacks. For example, a log entry might show that an ATCP senator was identified on port Gigabit 8, and the TCP SYN packet destined for the local system was automatically blocked for 60 seconds.</p>

<h2>Metadata</h2>
<p>Sometimes, important information is contained within the documents we transfer over the network or store inside the documents we create using word processors, spreadsheets, or graphic programs. For example, metadata within email headers can provide details like the servers that sent the email or the specified destination addresses. If you view the full email, you may uncover this metadata. Similarly, photos taken with mobile devices often contain GPS coordinates, device information, and location data. Browsers also store metadata, such as the operating system, browser type, and IP address. In word processing documents or spreadsheets, metadata can include the creator’s name, address, phone number, and even their title.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, let’s look at an email header, which may contain extensive information such as the IP addresses that the message passed through, SPF information, signatures, and other details that can help determine the origin of the email and the transfer process used to deliver it to your inbox.</p>

<h2>Vulnerability Scans</h2>
<p>Performing vulnerability scans on your network generates an extensive amount of log information, providing details on what the scan identifies. For example, it may flag devices on your network that lack a firewall, antivirus, or anti-spyware. The logs can also highlight misconfigured devices, such as accessible shares without authentication or operating systems with guest access enabled, when best practices call for disabling guest accounts entirely. Additionally, once you update the signatures in your vulnerability scanner, it can identify any operating systems or applications with known vulnerabilities that require patching.</p>
<h2>Automated Reports</h2>
<p>As you've probably seen already, there is an extensive amount of log information to sift through in order to find relevant details. Fortunately, most Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems include the ability to generate automated reports. This feature may be built directly into the SIEM, or you might use a third-party report generator that accesses the data stored in the SIEM.</p>
<p>However, these reports are only valuable if someone actually reads them. A common stumbling block in many organizations is that automated reports are generated regularly—but then ignored when they arrive in an inbox. Simply generating them isn’t enough; they need to be reviewed and acted upon.</p>
<p>Creating effective reports also takes some finesse. You’ll need to find the right balance between the type of report you need and the resources required to generate it. In SIEM environments that store terabytes of data, generating a single report can demand significant processing power. That’s why it’s essential to be specific and efficient in the reports you choose to generate.</p>
<h2>Dashboards</h2>
<p>Instead of waiting a day or two for full reports to be generated by the SIEM, it can be more efficient to have a real-time summary of critical information that’s accessible at a glance. This is where dashboards come in.</p>
<p>Many SIEMs and other security tools offer dashboards—customizable or predefined views that display key metrics and alerts in a clear, visual format. These dashboards are especially valuable in environments like security operations centers, where instant visibility into the current security posture is essential.</p>
<p>Dashboards typically focus on short-term, high-priority data rather than long-term trends, since compiling extensive historical information can take time and resources. Instead, they’re designed to provide real-time or near real-time snapshots of what’s happening across the network. For example, a dashboard might highlight the number of current intrusion attempts, recent malware alerts, system status indicators, or unauthorized login attempts—all easily scannable at a glance to help you respond quickly.</p>
<h2>Packet Captures</h2>
<p>One of the most valuable sources of data on your network is the network traffic itself. By analyzing packets in transit, you can uncover detailed insights about how your network is functioning, what applications are in use, and whether any suspicious or malicious activity is occurring.</p>
<p>This kind of analysis typically requires a third-party utility—<strong>Wireshark</strong> is a widely used example. Tools like Wireshark allow you to capture and inspect traffic at the packet level, whether it's traveling over wired or wireless connections. In some cases, your infrastructure devices—such as <strong>switches</strong>, <strong>routers</strong>, or <strong>firewalls</strong>—may also include built-in packet capture features.</p>
<p>Packet captures provide an extremely granular view of traffic flows, showing every individual bit and byte moving across the network. This level of detail is crucial for troubleshooting, forensic analysis, and identifying security threats. Whether you're looking for abnormal protocols, unauthorized connections, or application misbehavior, capturing network packets gives you the visibility you need to take action.</p></div>
