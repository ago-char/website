<h1>Identity and Access Management</h1>
<p>As you're aware, we use applications on many different systems in many different locations. We have applications that run on our desktop computers, our laptop devices and our mobile devices, and the data we're accessing can be located anywhere. It might be locally on that device, it might be in a data center or we might store that data in the cloud. </p>
<p>We've also got many different kinds of users that need access to different types of data. Employees of the company are accessing data differently than vendors, contractors or even the customers from a security perspective, we need to give the right permissions to the right people at the right times too provide them with the access that they need. We refer to this as identity and access management or IAM.  </p>
<p>IAM begins with the process of a user needing access and it ends with removing that access from the user. This might be a process that occurs during on boarding and offboarding. There's many times in between where we need to make changes to these permissions. IAm is responsible for determining access control. So when someone starts with the company, they may have a list of priorities, they may need access to email access to a primary application and access to the internet. The authentication and authorization process requires the user to identify themselves in some way, generally, with a username of password or perhaps some other type of authentication factor and once the user has the access they need, we need to log and monitor all of the access to this data. Not only is this a good best practice for security, but this may be something that is regulated and required based on the organization you're working for.</p>
<h2>Provisioning/De-provisioning User Accounts</h2>
<p>This, IAM process generally starts with the creation of a user account and it generally ends when that user account is deactivated. This of course, commonly happens during on-boarding and off-boarding but this might also change if someone was promoted or moves to a different part of the company.</p>
<p>If we were to look into the details of the information provided in IAM, we would see that we have a name of a user, any attributes for that user we have group permissions and then any other permissions for application access. This process of provisioning a user and deprovisioning the user account is the core to the IAM process and it's one that is required to be assured that the right permissions are being assigned. Not only does this assign the user with ritht  permissions for them to be able to do their job. But it limits any type of ongoing and extended access. For example, you would not assign administrator access to every person who comes on board in the organization.</p>
<h2>Permission Assignments</h2>
<p>One of the primary goals with IAM is to ensure that the permissions assigned to a user are the ones necessary for that user to do their job and no permissions extended beyond that particular goal. In many organizations, we have mandatory access control where there is a group that is associated with those rights and permissions, so if a new user is hired and they need email permissions, they're simply added to the email group. Any documents that user creates are private to that user by default. If someone else logs into that same device, they would not be able to access the files created by the original user. This is an important part of the permissions associated with the user's rights. And of course, we would limit a user's access to the core operating system on that device. This not only keeps the user from making any changes to the operating system. It also keeps any third party applications and malware for making changes to the OS.</p>
<h2>Identity Proofing</h2>
<p>Another big part of IAM is verifying who we user might be refer to this as identity proofing. There should be a formal process, especially during the creation of an account to verify that a user really is who they say they are. This process is referred to as resolution. And it's an important step to ensure that we're not assigning rights and permissions to someone who should not be on this network. It's also important that we're able to obtain additional validation from the user. This means the user needs to provide something that only they know, such as a password. They might also need to provide additional information such as the answers to security questions.  And of course, all of this needs to be verified through process called <strong>Attestation/Verification</strong>.This is one where we need additional details to really verify that person's identity. Many times this is done through the use of government documents like a passport or Driver's license and it might also include an in person meeting. There are also a number of automated verification options that might look at the user's credit report and ask specific questions about where a person may have lived or the type of assets that they might have owned.</p>
<h2>Gaining Access</h2>
<p>When user needs to gain access to a resource on the network, they need to provide some type of authentication. This usually begins with the client sending information into a central point that can be used for authentication. This might be on a VPN concentrator or logging in to an active directory infrastructure.</p>
<p>The user will provide authentication details such as a user name and password. And there's usually a synthronized authentication server that will be used to validate that information if that login information is correct. The authentication server will send back a notice saying that those credentials have been approved and the users then able to gain access to that resource.</p>
<p><img src="/pics/authentication-process.png" alt="authentication-process.png"></p>
<h2>SSO : Single sign-on</h2>
<p>If you work in a windows environment, you're probably familiar with single sign on SSO. This is the process where you would log in one time to the network and from that point forward you gain access to all of the resources that you might need; regardless of where those resources may be located.</p>
<p>Without SSO, every time you would need to access a new printer or access a different share on the network, you would have to provide your username and password every time. This is usually on a timer, so once you log in the first time, you may have access all of the resources you need for 24HR. After that 24 hour period you would need to provide authentication again for the SSO to apply. This means that your log in credentials and the underlying authorization process have to support. </p>
<h2>LDAP : LightWeight Directory Access Protocol</h2>
<p>One common authentication protocol LDAP. LDAP stands for a lightweight directory access protocol and it's a protocol for accessing large directories of data on a network. This is a very standardized protocol. The standard is the X.500 specification. It was written by the international telecommunication Union or the ITU. One of the original versions of this protocol was the directory access protocol or DAP, and it ran using the OSI protocol. This was updated to a type of protocol that would work with other operating systems much more efficiently, so it was renamed the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. </p>
<p>If you ever work with LDAP, you'll see a very standard format for listing out what's called distinguished names In  X.500 and it starts with an attribute, an equal sign and the value of that attribute, for example, CN, which stands for a common name, refers to an individual device. And of course, this is built in a way that you can have a structure within the database. The structure allows you to build a tree where you can organize all of the different devices users and other components on your network. </p>
<p><img src="/pics/x500-dir-info-tree.png" alt="x500-dir-info-tree.png"></p>
<p>These container objects could refer to the country where these objects are located in organization within that country. Different organizational units or departments and even individual devices within that department. We refer to this as the director.  Tree information tree and each of these individual components in the tree are referred to as leaf objects.</p>
<h2>SAML</h2>
<p>Another standard protocol for authentication and authorization is SAML i.e. <strong>Security Assertion Mark up Language</strong>. SAML allows for the authentication of a user to a third party database. So instead of maintaining your own database of users, you can simply use one that's already been created elsewhere. One of the challenges with SAML, however, is that it was never designed for mobile devices. And of course, these days we use our mobile devices extensively and are often logged in from multiple devices at the same time. We'll discuss some other authentication methods in a moment that work a little better when you add multiple devices. Especially those that are mobile. </p>
<h3>SAML Authentication Flow</h3>
<p><img src="/pics/SAML-auth.png" alt="SAML-auth.png"></p>
<p>A basic sample process involves 3 different devices one would be the device you're using that would be the <em>client device</em> and you're usually in a browser. You also are trying to gain access to a resource. There's your <em>resource server</em> on the network and the process of authentication and authorization takes place on a separate <em>authorization server</em>. </p>
<p>This process starts on the client where the client wants to access a URI on the resource server. Since this user is not logged in, the resource server sends an encrypted SAML request and redirects that to the authorization server. The user then provides user credentials to be able to gain access to that resource and the authorization server checks those credentials and approves that the credentials were correct and creates SAMtoken. The client now has a copy of the token that was generated by the authorization server and now they only need to present the same token to the resource server to then gain access to the resource and the application that they want to use.</p>
<h2>OAuth</h2>
<p>An authentication protocol that was built to work with our more modern and mobile systems is OAuth. OAuth is an authorization framework and once you authenticate, it determines what resources a user may have access to. The OAuth Authorization framework was built by some of the largest companies in the industry. Since these companies wanted to provide access for all of their users wherever they might be from whatever systems they may be using, OAuth was the solution. Since oath is an authorization framework, there still needs to be something providing authentication. So you often see OpenID using conjunction with OAuth to combine both the authentication and the authorization. </p>
<p><img src="/pics/oauth-example.png.png" alt="oauth-example.png.png"></p>
<p>Above is an example of an authorization  go off the authorization screen. This is one where we would like to access resources that are located in my Google account. And I want to use a third party application to be able to do that. In this case, the third party application is zappier to provide this access. I visit my zapier website and tell zappier I would like to use resources on my Google account. Zappier then asks me for authorization to gain access to those resources on my Google account specifically to see edit create and delete anything that's in my Google drive. Once I click allow, I've now created a link between zapier and my Google account using OAuth.</p>
<h2>Federation Authentication</h2>
<p>There may be times when you would like to log in to a resource. But you don't want to create another account on that particular resource. Instead, you may want to take advantage of federation. Federation allows network access without using a local authentication database. This can be done from many third parties that can then use a separate authentication database for logging in. You've probably seen a screen like this.</p>
<p><img src="/pics/login-options.png" alt="login-options.png"></p>
<p>When logging in on a website you could of course, use a separate email and password that is local to that site or you can simply use your Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn accounts on this site to be able to authenticate into that third party site for this to work properly, the website has to set up some relationship with Twitter Facebook and LinkedIn so that, this authentication process can occur. But once that link is made, any users who visit the site can use their existing login credentials on those services to log in to this third party website.</p>
<h2>Interoperability</h2>
<p>In this chapter we've talked about a number of different technologies and a number of different authentication and authorization services. When an organization is making a decision on which technologies they should be using, they have to make sure that all of these are interoperable (able to exchange and make use of information). <strong>Sometimes this interoperability decision is based on what you happen to have at the time</strong>. </p>
<p>For eg : We installed new VPN concentrator and looking at the options available on this VPN concentrator you can see that it does support access to an LDAP server for authentication. So, if you already have AD running or some other type of technology integrated with LDAP server for authentication, you would like to keep that uniformity. That is a perfect match between what the VPN concentrator needs and the resources you have currently. </p>
<p>Or may be you installed any other app and that application uses OAuth as a way of authorization. This means that you'll need to include some method of providing authorization through an API so that you can then pass that information on to OAuth to use for authorization. These interrogability decisions obviously need to be made of what the organization is trying to accomplish in long or short run and what their goals might be for the future.</p></div>
