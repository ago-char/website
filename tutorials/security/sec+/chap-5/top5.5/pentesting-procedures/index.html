<h1>Pentesting</h1>
<p>We often view <strong>penetration testing</strong> as a purely offensive activity, but in practice, it involves a balance between both offensive and defensive operations. The <strong>offensive side</strong> is carried out by the <strong>red team</strong>, whose role is to simulate real-world attacks by probing systems, identifying vulnerabilities, and attempting to exploit them. This mimics the tactics of actual threat actors and helps uncover hidden weaknesses in an organization's infrastructure.</p>
<p>On the <strong>defensive side</strong>, the <strong>blue team</strong> is responsible for monitoring systems, detecting intrusions in real-time, and responding to potential threats. Their job is to identify attack patterns, block intrusions, and harden systems based on observed vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The most effective security posture comes from <strong>red and blue team collaboration</strong>, often referred to as a <strong>purple team</strong> approach. In this setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>red team</strong> continuously tests the organization’s defenses by simulating advanced threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>blue team</strong> learns from these attacks, adapts defenses, and improves monitoring and response mechanisms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information flows both ways: red team findings are immediately relayed to the blue team, allowing them to <strong>patch systems, improve detection rules, and reduce future risk</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This <strong>constant feedback loop</strong> helps create a more resilient security environment by blending offensive and defensive insights into a unified cybersecurity strategy.</p>
<h2>Pentesting Environment</h2>
<p>Penetration testing can vary significantly depending on the <strong>amount of information provided</strong> to the tester beforehand. The level of information disclosure directly affects the strategies and techniques used during the assessment. The three common types of testing environments are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Known Environment (Full Disclosure)</strong><br />
    In this scenario, the organization provides the <strong>penetration tester with complete information</strong> about the target systems, such as network architecture, IP ranges, and software versions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is often used to <strong>maximize depth</strong> in testing specific systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It allows for a <strong>thorough and efficient evaluation</strong> of vulnerabilities and configurations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s also useful for internal testing where time and scope are critical.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Partially Known Environment</strong><br />
    This is a <strong>hybrid model</strong>, where the tester is given <strong>limited or selected information</strong> about the target environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It simulates an attacker who may have <strong>some insider knowledge</strong> (e.g., a disgruntled employee or a contractor).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It allows organizations to test <strong>how well critical assets hold up</strong> when they are targeted directly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unknown Environment (Blind Test)</strong><br />
    In a blind test, the penetration tester starts with <strong>no prior knowledge</strong> of the systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This simulates a <strong>real-world external attacker</strong> who must perform reconnaissance, scanning, enumeration, and exploitation from scratch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s useful for testing the organization’s <strong>defensive detection and response capabilities</strong>, especially the blue team’s awareness and alerting mechanisms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these approaches serves different goals—<strong>known tests</strong> are efficient for validating system hardening, <strong>partially known tests</strong> are balanced for both technical and real-world insight, and <strong>unknown tests</strong> are best for simulating realistic threat scenarios.</p>
<h2>Reconnaissance</h2>
<p>Even when a <strong>penetration tester</strong> is given full access to environment details, they still need to conduct a <strong>reconnaissance phase</strong> to prepare for an effective attack. This phase is essential for gathering <strong>accurate and actionable intelligence</strong> about the target's systems, configurations, and defenses.</p>
<p>The reconnaissance process involves discovering:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What security tools</strong> (firewalls, IDS/IPS) are in place</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What operating systems and applications</strong> are running on servers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IP address configurations</strong> and <strong>network topology</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remote site connections</strong> and potential pivot points</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From this, testers can <strong>build a network map</strong> and identify the most valuable systems for deeper exploitation.</p>
<h3>Types of Reconnaissance</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Passive Reconnaissance</strong><br />
    This involves gathering information <strong>without directly interacting</strong> with the target’s network, reducing the chance of detection.<br />
    Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Social media mining</strong> (employee roles, technologies in use)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Corporate websites</strong> and <strong>press releases</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Online forums</strong>, such as Reddit or job postings that mention infrastructure details</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Third-party conversations</strong> (e.g., vendors who work with the organization)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dumpster diving</strong> to recover discarded documents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social engineering</strong> to trick employees into revealing sensitive details</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Active Reconnaissance</strong><br />
    This involves <strong>direct interaction</strong> with systems on the target network. It is more revealing but also <strong>more detectable</strong>, since activities may be logged by security devices.<br />
    Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ping sweeps</strong> and <strong>port scans</strong> (e.g., using Nmap)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DNS queries</strong> to gather domain-related data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>OS fingerprinting</strong> (e.g., TTL analysis, TCP/IP stack behavior)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service and version scanning</strong> on open ports</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Banner grabbing</strong> to identify application details</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While passive reconnaissance helps attackers stay under the radar, active reconnaissance provides <strong>real-time, specific insights</strong> that are crucial for exploiting vulnerabilities. Both methods are essential parts of a <strong>well-rounded penetration testing strategy</strong>.</p></div>
