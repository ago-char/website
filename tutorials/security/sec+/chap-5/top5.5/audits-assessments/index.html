<h1>Audits and Assessments</h1>
<p>The term <strong>audit</strong> often carries a negative tone, but in the context of <strong>IT security</strong>, it serves a valuable and proactive purpose. A <strong>cybersecurity audit</strong> allows an organization to examine key components of its technology environment, including the <strong>infrastructure</strong>, <strong>software</strong>, and <strong>network-connected devices</strong>. Additionally, it involves reviewing existing <strong>policies and procedures</strong> to ensure they provide adequate protection against modern threats.</p>
<p>Audits can reveal <strong>vulnerabilities</strong> in the system before malicious actors exploit them, thus strengthening the overall security posture. These audits can be conducted <em><strong>internally</strong></em>, using in-house staff, or by <strong>external third-party</strong> specialists who offer an objective perspective.</p>
<p>You'll often hear the terms <strong>audit</strong> and <strong>attestation</strong> used together. After performing an audit, an organization may <strong>attest</strong> to the findings—this is a formal statement or opinion about the <strong>truthfulness and accuracy</strong> of the audit results.</p>
<p>Organizations may form an <strong>audit committee</strong> responsible for overseeing <strong>risk management</strong> and initiating or ending internal audits. The process typically starts with a <strong>self-assessment</strong>, where teams evaluate how well internal processes align with compliance requirements. The audit committee then consolidates these assessments to understand the organization’s overall compliance posture.</p>
<p>In some cases, especially when required by law or specific <strong>compliance regulations</strong>, a third-party audit is necessary. These <strong><em>external audits</em></strong> are conducted at regular intervals as dictated by the regulation. During such audits, external professionals examine records, processes, and controls to determine the current state of compliance and identify areas for improvement.</p>
<p>In summary, cybersecurity audits—whether internal or external—are essential for identifying weaknesses, ensuring regulatory compliance, and maintaining a secure and resilient IT environment.</p></div>
