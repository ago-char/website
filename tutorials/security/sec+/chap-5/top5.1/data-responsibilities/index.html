<h1>Data Responsibilities</h1>
<p>There are many different people in the organization responsible for different aspects of the data that are stored, and in this video, we'll look at some of those data responsibilities. The first responsibility we'll look at is the data owner. The data owner is usually someone at a higher level in the organization who is broadly responsible for that data. </p>
<p>For example, the Vice President of Sales would be the data owner for all of the customer relationship data, and the Treasurer of the organization would be the data owner for all of the financial information. These individuals are responsible for overseeing all aspects of this data, and they are ultimately responsible for all of the data associated with that particular role.</p>
<h1>Data Roles</h1>
<p>There are various roles within an organization responsible for different aspects of data. The <strong>data owner</strong> is usually a senior individual in the organization who oversees the data being stored. For example, the Vice President of Sales would be the <strong>data owner</strong> for customer relationship data, and the Treasurer would be the <strong>data owner</strong> for financial information. These individuals are ultimately responsible for the data associated with their role.</p>
<p>The <strong>data controller</strong> manages how the data will be used, while the <strong>data processor</strong> is the one who processes or uses the data. Often, the <strong>data controller</strong> provides instructions to the <strong>data processor</strong> on how the data should be handled. For example, the <strong>payroll controller</strong> (the payroll department) could be the <strong>data controller</strong>, while the <strong>data processor</strong> might be the payroll company. The payroll department ensures employees get paid and provides instructions to the payroll company, which processes payroll using user information and bank details.</p>
<p>There is also the role of the <strong>data custodian</strong> or <strong>data steward</strong>, who is responsible for the security and accuracy of data. The <strong>data custodian</strong> ensures the organization complies with laws and regulations regarding data, assigns sensitivity labels, and manages access control to ensure users only access the data they need.</p>
