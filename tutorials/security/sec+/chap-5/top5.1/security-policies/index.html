<h1>Security Policies</h1>
<h2>Security Policy Guidelines</h2>
<p>One primary goal of every security administrator is to ensure <strong>confidentiality</strong>, <strong>integrity</strong>, and <strong>availability</strong>—often abbreviated as <strong>CIA</strong>. To achieve CIA, we need clearly defined rules or policies that everyone must follow in order to maintain this level of security.</p>
<p>These security policies might outline broad organizational goals. For example, there might be data storage requirements or specific procedures that must be followed in the event of an incident. In addition to general guidelines, there is often a need for more <strong>detailed security policies</strong>. For instance, there may be regulations on how the Wi-Fi network should be used or specific requirements for obtaining <strong>remote access</strong> to the network.</p>
<p>Security policies help define <strong>what we should be doing and why</strong>, forming the basis of operational behavior. The implementation and administration of these policies are closely tied to <strong>technical security controls</strong>, which may have been covered earlier in your learning.</p>
<h2>Information Security Policies</h2>
<p>Most organizations with a security team will maintain <strong>comprehensive information security policies</strong>—a master list of rules designed to ensure <strong>uptime, availability, and security</strong> of the network. In some cases, these policies are not just recommendations but <strong>mandatory</strong> directives that the organization is required to implement and enforce.</p>
<p>Security policies serve as a guide to address various operational and security-related questions. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What should be done when a virus is discovered on an employee’s workstation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What process should be followed when someone wants to connect to the VPN from their home computer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What steps should be taken when a vulnerability is exploited to gain unauthorized access?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to all these questions should be documented within the <strong>organization’s security policy</strong>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the security policy outlines the <strong>roles and responsibilities</strong> of individuals involved in maintaining the organization’s security. This ensures clear communication channels for addressing any security concerns. As with any documentation, these policies are only effective if they are <strong>actively enforced</strong> and <strong>kept up to date</strong> by the organization.</p>
<h2>AUP - Acceptable Use Policies</h2>
<p>One set of policies that applies to everyone in the organization is the <strong>AUP</strong>, or <strong>Acceptable Use Policy</strong>. This defines what users are permitted to do with the technology provided to them. The AUP outlines what is considered <strong>acceptable behavior</strong> when using organizational resources such as computers, telephones, mobile devices, and any other form of technology.</p>
<p>This policy serves not only as a way to <strong>inform employees</strong> about proper and expected use of technology, but also as a tool to <strong>protect the organization</strong> from legal liability. For example, if someone is dismissed for violating the AUP, the organization has <strong>documented evidence</strong> that supports the reason for the dismissal and clarifies the expectations that were not met.</p>
<h2>Business Continuity</h2>
<p>On a normal business day, we have access to our laptops, mobile devices, networks, and any other technology owned by the company. We're so accustomed to using these technologies that we often don't consider what would happen if they suddenly became unavailable. This is one of the key reasons why having a set of <strong>business continuity policies</strong> is essential.</p>
<p>For example, imagine you work for a retail organization, and today the network used to process credit card transactions goes down. By referring to your <strong>business continuity plan</strong>, you'd know that the alternative process involves conducting <strong>manual transactions</strong> and making <strong>phone calls to the credit card company</strong> to get manual approvals.</p>
<p>The main challenge with business continuity is that you must <strong>plan for disruptions in advance</strong>. This requires thorough documentation and <strong>regular testing</strong> to ensure that the plans you've established will function properly in the event of a disaster.</p>
<h2>Disaster Recovery Plan</h2>
<p>And if the type of disaster that occurs is widespread or lasts for an extended period of time, you’ll need a formal set of policies known as a <strong>disaster recovery plan</strong>. You can think of this as an extension of the business continuity plan, but designed to apply to everyone in the organization affected by the disaster.</p>
<p>One of the main challenges in creating a disaster recovery plan is the wide variety of potential disasters. These can include <strong>natural disasters</strong> such as tornadoes, hurricanes, or floods, <strong>technology failures</strong> like loss of connectivity to critical systems, or <strong>human-caused events</strong> that disrupt operations. Any of these scenarios can affect the organization's ability to function, which is why it's critical to have <strong>comprehensive disaster recovery plans</strong> in place.</p>
<p>For instance, you may need a <strong>secondary recovery location</strong> if the primary one becomes unavailable. There must also be a reliable <strong>data recovery process</strong> in case of data loss, as well as procedures for <strong>application restoration</strong> to bring systems back online. Additionally, the <strong>IT team and key personnel</strong> must be able to reach and operate from the recovery location to ensure operations continue as smoothly as possible.</p>
<h2>Security Incidents</h2>
<p>We should also have detailed documentation on how to deal with different security incidents. For example, let’s say a user receives an email with an attachment. They double-click the attachment and run the executable, which results in malware being installed on their device. The malware then immediately begins communicating with an external server. There should be a set of security policies in place to determine the next steps for handling this type of issue.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s not the only type of security incident we need to consider. We may also face threats like a <strong>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)</strong> attack or a <strong>botnet attack</strong> that causes systems to become unavailable. Additionally, we should plan for incidents where confidential information from within the organization is exposed to unauthorized parties. If any sensitive data is stolen, security incident policies should be in place so we know exactly what actions to take in response.</p>
<h2>Incidient Response Roles</h2>
<p>To be able to react to these types of security incidents, we need a specialized team that knows exactly how to handle each and every one of these situations. We refer to these teams as <strong>incident responders</strong>, and there are many different roles that may exist within your organization. We’ll look at a number of those here.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the <strong>incident response team</strong> itself. This is a specialized group that is trained and tested to be ready for any type of security event. In addition to this team, we might also rely on the <strong>IT security management team</strong> to obtain the proper resources and people to address these types of incidents.</p>
<p>If the organization has significant compliance requirements, you likely have <strong>compliance officers</strong> who are hired to ensure that all of the data and systems meet the necessary regulatory mandates. Obviously, the folks working in the trenches to solve the technical problems that arise during these events will be the <strong>technical staff</strong>. Finally, our <strong>user community</strong> can provide valuable information about what they observed during the security event, helping to piece together what occurred.</p>
<h2>NIST SP800-61</h2>
<p>If you're curious about the process an organization might follow when security incidents occur, you might want to read through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) document titled <strong>NIST Special Publication 800-61 Revision 2</strong>, also known as <strong>The Computer Security Incident Handling Guide</strong>. This guide walks you through the response lifecycle for security incidents, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong>: What steps should be taken before an incident occurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Detection and Analysis</strong>: How to identify and analyze a security incident.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Containment, Eradication, and Recovery</strong>: The process for containing the incident, removing any threats, and recovering affected systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Post-Incident Activity</strong>: What to do after the incident to prevent future occurrences and improve processes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While the details of this document are a bit outside the scope of the Security+ exam, it might help provide more context for understanding security incidents and the best practices for handling them.</p>
<h2>SDLC - Software Development LifeCycle</h2>
<p>If you're an application developer, there are setup processes and procedures associated with creating software. This is referred to as the <strong>Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)</strong>. The goal of the SDLC is to move from the idea phase all the way through until we have a fully developed application. This typically involves creating requirements, working with end users, building the application, testing it, and then deploying it — all while staying on schedule and within budget.</p>
<p>Although there's no universally perfect way to navigate the SDLC, having some structure in place can help keep the team focused and ensure the successful development of the application.</p>
<p>Two of the most common application development lifecycles are <strong>Agile</strong> and <strong>Waterfall</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Waterfall Lifecycle</strong> is a linear approach that starts with gathering requirements, moves through development, testing, deployment, and finally into ongoing maintenance. Each phase is completed before moving on to the next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Agile Lifecycle</strong>, on the other hand, is designed to be much faster. It emphasizes continuous design, development, testing, deployment, and review throughout the entire process. Agile works in iterative cycles, meaning the application is developed in chunks, with each cycle contributing toward the final product. Once enough cycles have been completed, the application is ready to be launched.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Change Management</h2>
<p>Another important set of policies in every organization is <strong>change management</strong>. Whenever a change is needed, there should be a defined process associated with it. For example, this could involve updating an application, modifying a firewall configuration, or altering a router or switch configuration. In all these situations, a change must occur, but we need to ensure that it will not negatively impact the organization.</p>
<p>The <strong>change management process</strong> is ongoing, and it’s common to have weekly meetings to discuss the planned changes for the upcoming week. Unfortunately, in many organizations, the change management process is either overlooked or not used at all, which can have serious consequences for the organization’s functionality.</p>
<p>The change management process provides clear documentation that outlines:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How often changes will occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The duration of each change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The procedure for implementing the change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fallback procedure if the change does not go as planned.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Organizations with a well-defined change management structure can implement changes with minimal risk to their operations. If your organization does not have a formal change management process, it’s a good idea to start working on creating and implementing these policies as soon as possible.</p></div>
