<h1>Security Standards</h1>
<p>In the technology industry, we rely on <strong>standards</strong> to define formal processes for handling various situations. These standards provide <strong>extensive documentation</strong>, which helps everyone understand the specific <strong>requirements</strong> involved and significantly <strong>reduces the amount of risk</strong> within the environment.</p>
<p>Some organizations may create their <strong>own list of security standards</strong>, especially if they have <strong>unique internal requirements</strong>. However, many prefer to use <strong>pre-established standards</strong> that have already been widely adopted and vetted.</p>
<p>Two major organizations that provide these kinds of security standards are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ISO</strong> – The <em>International Organization for Standardization</em>, which creates globally recognized frameworks for information security and other domains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NIST</strong> – The <em>National Institute of Standards and Technology</em>, which provides detailed guidelines and best practices, especially widely used in the United States.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these standards ensures consistency, improves compliance, and helps in managing and mitigating security risks effectively.</p>
<h2>Password</h2>
<p>A set of security standards that everyone in an organization must know and follow are those specifically associated with <strong>passwords</strong>. Passwords are a fundamental part of information security, and every organization typically defines formal <strong>password policies</strong> that describe what constitutes a <strong>strong password</strong> and how authentication should be managed.</p>
<p>Different organizations may have slightly different views on what makes a good password, but the core components are usually centered around <strong>password complexity</strong>. This includes rules on minimum length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and so on.</p>
<p>Beyond complexity, the <strong>password policy</strong> may also define:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Authentication standards</strong>: For example, the organization might require all switches, routers, or firewalls to <strong>authenticate using a centralized method</strong> like <strong>LDAP</strong> or <strong>RADIUS</strong>, rather than relying on local device accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Password reset procedures</strong>: To ensure account security, password changes or resets must follow a <strong>standardized and secure process</strong>, possibly requiring identity verification or administrative approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Password change frequency</strong>: Policies might enforce changing passwords every 60 or 90 days, although modern best practices often focus more on detecting breaches than frequent changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure password storage</strong>: Standards should ensure that passwords are stored securely (e.g., using salted hashes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Approved password managers</strong>: Organizations may also list which <strong>password management tools</strong> are approved for storing and generating passwords securely.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These policies ensure that every user maintains good security hygiene and helps prevent unauthorized access through weak or compromised credentials.</p>
<h2>Access Control</h2>
<p>Once someone successfully authenticates to a system with their password, we need another set of standards to determine <strong>how they can access data</strong> on that system. These standards fall under the category of <strong>access control</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Access control</strong> policies specify what type of information a user can access, when they can access it, and under what conditions. These policies are essential to maintaining the <strong>confidentiality, integrity, and availability</strong> of data.</p>
<p>For example, an organization might have a policy that prohibits the use of <strong>Discretionary Access Control (DAC)</strong> and instead requires <strong>Mandatory Access Control (MAC)</strong>, which enforces strict rules defined by the system, not by the individual data owner.</p>
<p>There should also be well-defined procedures for determining <strong>what level of access</strong> a specific user should have. This might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Managerial approval</strong>: Access to sensitive resources may require sign-off by a supervisor or department head.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: A user may need to complete <strong>security training</strong> or a <strong>certification course</strong> before being granted access to particular systems or data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Role-based access</strong>: Permissions may be assigned based on the user’s job role using <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as it is important to control how access is granted, it's equally important to define <strong>how access is revoked</strong>. This could occur due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>security violation</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>expiration of an account</strong> or temporary credentials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>user leaving the organization</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>completion or termination of a contract</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These standards help ensure that access to data is granted responsibly and revoked appropriately to reduce the risk of unauthorized data exposure.</p>
<h2>Physical Security</h2>
<p>Physical security is also an important consideration when creating standards for the organization, especially if your environment involves a constant flow of employees, contractors, and guests. Ensuring the safety of both people and property requires well-defined physical security policies.</p>
<p>For example, an organization may have a <strong>standard requiring all users to present an ID badge</strong> upon arrival. That same badge might also be used to gain access to different parts of the building through <strong>electronic door locks</strong>. These access controls could be further refined depending on the user’s role:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Employees</strong> might have full access to the areas they need to work in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contractors</strong> could have limited access to only certain locations and during specific hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Guests</strong> may need to be escorted or signed in by an internal employee.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some physical security standards may go further by specifying the <strong>type of door lock mechanisms</strong> in use. For instance, a policy might require:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Card-based systems</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keypads with PINs</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Biometric authentication</strong> (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In high-security areas, the standards might also include <strong>motion detection systems</strong>, <strong>surveillance cameras</strong>, and <strong>alarm systems</strong> for after-hours monitoring.</p>
<p>Standards should also cover <strong>offboarding procedures</strong>. When an individual leaves the organization, there needs to be a clear policy for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Collecting and disabling ID badges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revoking physical access credentials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notifying security personnel</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These physical security standards ensure that internal staff remain safe and that unauthorized individuals are prevented from gaining access to sensitive or restricted areas.</p>
<h2>Encryption</h2>
<p><strong>Encryption Standards and Their Role in Organizational Security</strong></p>
<p>Given the complexities involved in encryption technologies, it is essential for every organization to maintain <strong>well-documented encryption standards</strong>. These standards guide how encryption should be implemented, what technologies are acceptable, and how data must be protected depending on its state.</p>
<p>A solid encryption policy may include:</p>
<h3>1. <strong>Hashing and Password Storage</strong></h3>
<p>Passwords should <strong>never be stored in plaintext</strong>. Instead, standards might require:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The use of <strong>cryptographic hash functions</strong> (e.g., SHA-256 or bcrypt)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application of <strong>salts</strong> to hashes to prevent rainbow table attacks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guidelines on how salts are generated, stored, and managed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rules on password iteration counts or key stretching</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Encryption Algorithms</strong></h3>
<p>The policy should specify <strong>approved encryption algorithms</strong> and their configurations, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AES-256</strong> for data encryption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RSA</strong> or <strong>ECC</strong> for asymmetric encryption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TLS 1.2 or 1.3</strong> for secure network communication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disallowed algorithms</strong>, like outdated DES, RC4, or MD5</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. <strong>Encryption Implementation Standards</strong></h3>
<p>Beyond algorithm selection, it's important to define:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Key generation and management practices</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Certificate usage and renewal policies</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure storage for private keys</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access control for encryption tools and APIs</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. <strong>Encryption by Data State</strong></h3>
<p>Data typically exists in three states, each with its own encryption requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data at Rest</strong>: Stored data (e.g., in databases, file systems)</p>
<ul>
<li>May require full-disk encryption or database-level encryption</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data in Transit</strong>: Data moving across networks</p>
<ul>
<li>Must use secure protocols like TLS, HTTPS, or VPNs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data in Use</strong>: Data currently being processed in memory</p>
<ul>
<li>May involve runtime protections or secure enclaves (e.g., Intel SGX)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each state should have <strong>specific policies</strong> to ensure the appropriate level of protection.</p>
<h3>5. <strong>Compliance and Confidentiality</strong></h3>
<p>Encryption standards also help:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensure <strong>regulatory compliance</strong> (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintain the <strong>confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)</strong> of sensitive information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent unauthorized access by internal or external actors</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By establishing <strong>comprehensive and enforced encryption standards</strong>, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and ensure that sensitive data remains protected—regardless of how or where it is accessed.</p></div>
