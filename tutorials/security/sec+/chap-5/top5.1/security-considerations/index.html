<h1>Security Considerations</h1>
<h2>Regulatory</h2>
<p>IT security professionals must be aware of the regulations that apply to their organization and the type of data being collected. This includes not only the information stored by applications but also the log files generated by those applications. There may also be requirements to retain certain types of information for extended periods. For example, some organizations are required to store emails for a specified number of years and ensure that data remains accessible when needed.</p>
<p>One regulation many organizations must follow is <strong>Sarbanes-Oxley</strong> (often abbreviated as <strong>SOX</strong>). Officially known as the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002, it focuses on an organizationâ€™s finances. <strong>Sarbanes-Oxley</strong> is broad in scope and can affect various parts of an organization. From an IT perspective, it ensures that all financial data is protected and accessible to authorized individuals within the organization.</p>
<p>In healthcare, professionals are familiar with <strong>HIPAA</strong> (the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). This regulation ensures that healthcare information is protected. It covers not only the data stored by healthcare providers but also how that information is transferred and disclosed to third parties.</p>
<h2>Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>If you're working in IT security, there will certainly be legal requirements associated with your role. This means that formal processes and procedures must be in place for the IT team to report any illegal activities. The IT security team is also responsible for responding to a legal hold, which ensures that data will be available for any future legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Many jurisdictions have specific rules regarding the disclosure of security breaches. If your organization discovers a security breach, it is legally mandated to disclose that breach within an appropriate timeframe. The rules and regulations around disclosures vary depending on the geography, so it is crucial to follow the legal requirements for your specific location.</p>
<p>While cloud computing offers significant advantages, it also presents legal challenges. With cloud computing, application instances can be created anywhere in the world, and the data associated with those applications may also be stored globally. However, some countries have legal guidelines on where information can be stored. For instance, some countries require that any data collected from their citizens must remain within their borders.</p>
<h2>Industry</h2>
<p>There are different security considerations for different industries, as organizations operate in unique ways, leading to varying approaches to IT security across environments. For example, when dealing with public utilities or electrical power generation, there are often strict requirements on how information can be accessed. This usually results in power-generating technologies being airgapped from the rest of the network.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the medical field, information must be readily available to authorized personnel but also remain highly secure. This is why medical environments implement extensive data encryption and other protection technologies, ensuring that private medical information is accessible to medical professionals while maintaining privacy from unauthorized individuals.</p>
<h2>Geographical Security</h2>
<p>Security considerations vary based on the scope of the organization. In organizations with a local or regional focus, data is typically tied to a specific area. For example, a city or state government may collect records to manage the city or county. As the organization expands to a national level, such as within a federal government, the scope broadens to include national defense and communication between states. With this increased scope, the need for confidentiality grows, leading to the implementation of advanced encryption and data protection technologies.</p>
<p>For global companies, the complexity increases due to the presence of offices in different countries. This introduces additional security challenges, as laws for data protection and security vary across different regions, making it a more complicated task to ensure compliance worldwide.</p></div>
