<h1>Third Party Risk Assessment</h1>
<p>Every organization works with third-party vendors in some capacity. These could include payroll service providers, external email marketing platforms, outsourced travel departments, or suppliers of raw materials. In all these cases, some level of company data is shared with the third party. While some of this data may be relatively low-risk, sharing information with a payroll provider, for example, involves handing over sensitive company and employee details.</p>
<p>Because of this, it's essential to conduct a <strong>third-party risk analysis</strong> to understand how your data is being handled and protected. Since these vendors operate outside your organization, it's also important to include the results and expectations of this risk assessment directly in the contract. Doing so clearly defines each party’s responsibilities and sets enforceable penalties in the event of a breach, helping to safeguard your company’s data and interests.</p>
<h2>Pentesting</h2>
<p>One common type of risk assessment is <strong>penetration testing</strong>. This is similar to a vulnerability scan, but instead of just identifying vulnerabilities, it involves actively attempting to exploit them—whether in an operating system or an application. Penetration testing might be an internal company requirement, or it could be a contractual obligation between your organization and a third party.</p>
<p>For example, the contract may require that both your company and the third party perform regular penetration tests at defined intervals. These tests are often conducted by an external company that specializes in penetration testing. This ensures that both you and your vendor receive independent, detailed reports on the security posture and how effectively existing protections are functioning.</p>
<h3>Rules of Engagement</h3>
<p>Most penetration tests also include a document called the <strong>rules of engagement</strong>, which sets the parameters to ensure everyone understands the scope of the test and which devices will be tested. For example, the rules of engagement might specify that the test is an <strong>on-site physical breach test</strong>, where someone attempts to gain access to your facility, or it could be an <strong>internal test</strong> within your company, or even an <strong>external test</strong> performed across the internet to simulate an outside attacker.</p>
<p>The rules can also define when the test will take place, such as on a particular date and time, or during specific hours—either normal working hours or after hours. Most rules of engagement will include details such as the <strong>IP address ranges</strong> that will be tested and <strong>emergency contacts</strong>, which are critical if something goes wrong during the test.</p>
<p>Additionally, the document might outline how the third-party tester should handle any sensitive information they come across during the penetration test. It may also specify which devices are <strong>in scope</strong> (i.e., to be tested) and which devices are <strong>out of scope</strong> (i.e., should not be tested).</p>
<h2>Right-to-Audit Clauses</h2>
<p>When working with a third-party vendor, organizations often share some form of data. This is especially true when outsourcing functions like payroll or using external services such as an internet provider, where all internet traffic passes through their network. In such cases, the third party may be holding and managing sensitive data on behalf of the organization. To ensure the security of this data, it’s a good practice to conduct regular audits of the third-party vendor's security practices.</p>
<p>Typically, this requirement is incorporated into the contract through a clause called the <strong>right to audit</strong>. This clause ensures that both parties agree to the regular auditing of security measures, and it may outline specific parameters and expectations for the audit process. The right to audit helps both organizations understand the security controls in place and how these controls protect sensitive information.</p>
<h2>Evidence of Internal Audits</h2>
<p>In many cases, neither you nor your vendors are the ones performing the audit. It’s common to bring in a third party to conduct the audit—someone independent of the contract. These audits may be required due to the type of data being handled and could be a compliance obligation for your organization. Even if compliance doesn't mandate it, conducting regular audits is a best practice from a security perspective. These audits typically focus on the security controls in place between your organization and the vendor.</p>
<p>For example, you might review access management policies, onboarding and offboarding procedures, password management practices, how passwords are stored, and what controls exist for granting or denying VPN access. There are often opportunities to strengthen existing security controls, and conducting an audit provides documentation that identifies those areas for improvement. Since most vendor relationships span long periods, it's important to schedule recurring audits at regular intervals rather than relying on a single assessment.</p>
<h3>Scenario to have independent audit</h3>
<p>You're the <strong>IT security manager</strong> at a mid-sized <strong>retail company</strong> that outsources its <strong>payment processing</strong> to a vendor like <strong>PayProSecure</strong>, a third-party payment gateway provider. Your company doesn’t handle the credit card information directly—PayProSecure manages all sensitive transaction data on your behalf.</p>
<p>Because this involves <strong>handling customer credit card information</strong>, you're required to comply with the <strong>PCI DSS</strong> (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). As part of this compliance, <strong>regular audits</strong> of your vendor’s security controls are necessary.</p>
<p>However, neither you (the retail company) nor PayProSecure (the vendor) performs the audit. Instead, you both agree to hire an <strong>independent PCI-certified auditor</strong> from a firm like <strong>SecureTrust</strong>, which specializes in PCI DSS audits.</p>
<h2>Supply Chain Analysis</h2>
<p>The supply chain refers to the full sequence of processes involved in producing and delivering a product, starting from raw materials and ending with the finished product in the hands of the customer. At each stage of this process, there are potential security risks that organizations must consider. To better understand and mitigate these risks, organizations often conduct a <strong>supply chain analysis</strong>. This allows them to map out the entire flow—from vendor to customer—and identify where vulnerabilities might exist.</p>
<p>One of the first steps in a supply chain analysis is to examine how a product or service is transferred from the vendor to the customer. This includes assessing the logistics, data exchanges, and interdependencies between parties. It's also important to evaluate how communication is handled across different departments and between different organizations. Gaps or weaknesses in these communications can introduce security risks.</p>
<p>On a technical level, organizations must assess how security mechanisms are enforced between their teams and the third-party vendors. This includes checking authentication processes, data transmission protocols, and access control measures. Any changes to business processes that involve the vendor should be well-documented and re-evaluated for security implications.</p>
<p>The importance of securing the supply chain was highlighted by a real-world incident involving <strong>SolarWinds</strong>. Between March and June 2020, attackers managed to breach SolarWinds' internal systems and insert <strong>malware</strong> into the code of their <strong>Orion</strong> software platform. This malicious code was digitally signed and deployed as a legitimate update, allowing it to spread to customer environments undetected. The breach was disclosed in December 2020. Out of approximately 300,000 customers, at least 18,000 installed the compromised update, including high-profile government and enterprise networks.</p>
<p>This event underscored the significance of thoroughly vetting the security of third-party vendors and the software they provide. It prompted many organizations to <strong>reassess their supply chain security protocols</strong>, particularly around code integrity, digital signatures, and vendor trust.</p>
<h2>Independent Assessments</h2>
<p>When working within an organization, your perspective is naturally limited to its internal policies, procedures, and culture. This can lead to <strong>blind spots</strong>—areas of risk or inefficiency that may not be visible from the inside. To address this, many organizations bring in <strong>independent third-party assessors</strong> who offer a broader, more objective viewpoint. These assessors are not influenced by internal biases or assumptions and can identify risks that internal teams may overlook.</p>
<p>A knowledgeable third party, especially one with experience across various industries, can draw on best practices and patterns observed in other environments. Their <strong>cross-organizational insight</strong> enables them to recommend improvements based on real-world scenarios and evolving threats. For example, they might detect outdated access control policies, overlooked misconfigurations, or missing monitoring capabilities.</p>
<p>By leveraging this <strong>external expertise</strong>, organizations can significantly strengthen their overall security posture. These assessments often lead to enhanced awareness, better resource allocation, and actionable recommendations—many of which internal teams may not have previously considered due to limited scope or experience.</p>
<h3>Vendor Selection Process</h3>
<p>Before engaging a third-party organization, performing <strong>due diligence</strong> is essential. This process involves thoroughly researching and validating information about the potential partner to ensure they are trustworthy, competent, and aligned with your organization’s values and security standards. Due diligence can include verifying financial claims (like revenue or customer base), checking for legal or regulatory issues, assessing reputation, reviewing service capabilities, and conducting background checks or interviews with key personnel.</p>
<p>While due diligence focuses on verifying facts and reducing risks, it’s equally important to assess the potential for <strong>conflicts of interest</strong>. A conflict of interest arises when a relationship or situation could impair objective decision-making. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The third-party vendor might already be working closely with your biggest competitor, raising concerns about <strong>confidentiality</strong> or <strong>preferential treatment</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of your organization's executives may have a <strong>personal connection</strong> to the vendor—such as a family member working there—which could compromise <strong>impartial decision-making</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third party might offer <strong>gifts, incentives, or favors</strong> in exchange for securing the contract, which creates <strong>ethical and legal risks</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These scenarios introduce risks to transparency, fairness, and business integrity. Identifying such conflicts early helps prevent reputational damage, regulatory violations, or compromised partnerships. When conflicts arise, organizations may choose to avoid the partnership altogether or put strict controls in place to manage the relationship objectively.</p>
<h3>Vendor Monitoring</h3>
<p>Once the contract is signed, the real work begins. Entering a business relationship with a third party also requires ongoing <strong>monitoring of the partnership</strong>, particularly from an <strong>IT security</strong> standpoint. This monitoring ensures the third party continues to meet agreed-upon security and performance standards over time.</p>
<p>Regular activities in this process may include <strong>financial health checks</strong> to assess the vendor’s stability and <strong>IT security reviews</strong> to verify that the partner maintains appropriate controls. It’s also beneficial to monitor <strong>public sources</strong>—such as news articles or social media—for any emerging risks or reputational concerns tied to the vendor.</p>
<p>Because organizations often work with multiple third parties, <strong>vendor-specific monitoring strategies</strong> might differ based on the type of service or risk level. For example, a cloud provider may require more rigorous technical audits than a payroll vendor.</p>
<p>Effective vendor monitoring typically includes both <strong>quantitative metrics</strong> (e.g., service uptime, incident response time) and <strong>qualitative assessments</strong> (e.g., responsiveness, professionalism). To manage this process, many organizations designate a specific <strong>team or individual</strong> responsible for overseeing third-party relationships. This team ensures that vendors are continually evaluated and that any deviations from agreed standards are addressed proactively.</p>
<h4>Questionnares</h4>
<p>One common method of vendor monitoring is to send a <strong>security or risk questionnaire</strong> to the third party. These questionnaires provide a straightforward way to gather detailed information about the vendor’s <strong>business practices, security controls</strong>, and <strong>risk management procedures</strong>.</p>
<p>For instance, the questionnaire might include questions about the vendor’s <strong>due diligence process</strong>, such as how they evaluate their own partners or prevent <strong>conflicts of interest</strong>. It may also ask about the vendor’s <strong>disaster recovery and business continuity plans</strong>—specifically, how they would maintain operations in case of a failure at their facility.</p>
<p>At a technical level, you may inquire about how your data is <strong>stored and protected</strong>, including the type of <strong>encryption</strong> used, <strong>access controls</strong>, and <strong>backup procedures</strong>. These questions help identify any gaps or risks in the vendor’s environment and may lead to <strong>recommended changes</strong> or added contractual requirements.</p>
<p>The responses from the vendor are typically included in your organization's <strong>vendor risk analysis</strong> and are <strong>continuously updated</strong> over time. This ensures that your organization maintains a current understanding of the vendor's security posture throughout the lifecycle of the relationship.</p></div>
