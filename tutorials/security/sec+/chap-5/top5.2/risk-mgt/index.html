<h1>Risk Management</h1>
<h2>Risk Identification</h2>
<p>Most organizations have some level of <strong>risk management</strong> that allows them to identify where risk might be and address it before it becomes a much larger problem. This is an important part of any organization, and as an organization grows larger, the risk grows larger as well. So it's important to understand where those risky areas may be. The risk management in most organizations is there to identify and manage any potential risk. The threats to an organization may come from the inside or the outside, and <strong>risk management</strong> allows the organization to qualify those risks.</p>
<h2>Performing Risk Assessment</h2>
<p>There are different ways to perform a <strong>risk assessment</strong>, and every organization has different requirements and concerns regarding threats. An organization could perform a <strong>one-time risk assessment</strong>. This is often related to a specific project, and the risk assessment is designed to address any concerns associated with that project. For example, a company may be acquiring another organization and may want to perform a risk assessment to evaluate what that acquisition might bring to the company. Or perhaps the organization is installing new equipment or new software and wants to understand the risks involved in implementing that new technology.</p>
<p>In some organizations, this <strong>risk assessment</strong> is an ongoing process. We see this very often with the <strong>change control process</strong>. One of the steps of change control is understanding what the risk may be when implementing a change. This is a process that occurs for every change that is submitted through the change control process.</p>
<h2>Ad hoc Assessments</h2>
<p>Ad hoc is a Latin phrase that means <em>for this</em>. We use it as <em>for this purpose only</em>, so when we're performing an <strong>ad hoc risk assessment</strong>, we're performing it for one specific purpose. For example, your CEO may return from a conference where he learned about a new attack type that has targeted other companies in attendance, and he wants to determine if your organization is susceptible to this specific risk.</p>
<p>To perform that study, an <strong>ad hoc assessment</strong> will be created that focuses solely on this specific attack type and how it may apply to your organization. The company may form a committee to perform a <strong>risk assessment</strong> of that specific threat. Once the assessment has been completed, the reports have been generated, and the presentation has been made to the CEO, that particular committee can be disbanded.</p>
<p>Since the <strong>scope</strong> of this particular assessment was relatively narrow, it's unlikely that another <strong>risk assessment</strong> would be needed for the same specific threat.</p>
<h2>Recurring/Timely Risk Assessment</h2>
<p>Some organizations perform <strong>risk assessments</strong> on a standard schedule, so you may be asked to conduct an assessment every three months, every six months, or annually. In some cases, this assessment is carried out internally without involving an external third party. For example, your <strong>internal assessment team</strong> may request updates every three months and maintain an ongoing set of documentation for the continuous assessment process.</p>
<p>There may also be <strong>risk assessments</strong> required as part of a regulatory or compliance mandate. For instance, if your organization stores credit card numbers, it may be required to perform an <strong>annual risk assessment</strong> in accordance with the <strong>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)</strong>.</p></div>
