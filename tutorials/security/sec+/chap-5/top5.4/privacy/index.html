<h1>Privacy Legal Implications</h1>
<p>Our organizations collect a massive amount of data, and there are privacy laws that likely apply to a significant portion of this information. In this video, we'll discuss some of these privacy concerns and how organizations are mandated to protect your data.</p>
<p>In many regions, privacy regulations begin at the local and state levels. Local governments often collect a wide range of data—such as details about our homes, vehicles, and medical licensing. At the national level, laws are enacted to protect the privacy of all citizens. For example, <strong>HIPAA</strong> regulations related to healthcare in the United States are a strong example of national-level laws designed to safeguard personal information.</p>
<p>Many countries are also working together to ensure privacy for all citizens, regardless of where they live. A good example of a privacy regulation that affects multiple countries is the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>. The GDPR is a European Union regulation that protects the privacy of individuals living in EU member states.</p>
<p>Protected information under GDPR includes names, addresses, photos, email addresses, banking details, social media posts, and much more. One of its key features is that it places control of personal data back into the hands of the individual. If someone believes their private information should be removed from a website, they can request its deletion, and the website is legally obligated to comply. This is referred to as the <strong>right to be forgotten</strong>.</p>
<p>The GDPR defines a <strong>data subject</strong> as any individual who can be identified directly or indirectly through data. This includes names, genetic information, location data, and more. Essentially, anyone residing in these jurisdictions qualifies as a data subject.</p>
<p>Unlike older laws that focused more on the responsibilities of companies and third parties, the GDPR and similar modern privacy laws emphasize the <strong>perspective of the data subject</strong>—ensuring individuals have greater control and rights over their own information.</p>
<h2>Data Responsibilities</h2>
<p>We've spoken in an earlier video about the responsibilities associated with data in an organization, but it's worthwhile to bring this up again in the context of privacy. We'll start with the concept of a <strong>data owner</strong>. This would be an individual who has overall responsibility for the data. For example, if you're the Vice President of Sales, you are the data owner for any customer relationship data. If you are the treasurer of the company, you would be the data owner for all of the financial information associated with the organization.</p>
<h2>Data Roles</h2>
<p>Many organizations also have <strong>data controllers</strong> and <strong>data processors</strong>. The <strong>data controller</strong> is responsible for managing how the data is used, and the <strong>data processor</strong> is the person or entity actually using the data. The data processor may be internal within your organization, or you may be using a third party to process that data.</p>
<p>For example, consider how data is used between a payroll department and a payroll company. The payroll department would be the <strong>data controller</strong>—they define how much people get paid and when they get paid. They then hand that information off to a third-party payroll company, which acts as the <strong>data processor</strong> by actually processing everyone's paychecks each week.</p>
<p>This relationship means that there is a great deal of private and personal data being transferred between the data controller and the data processor. In the case of a third-party vendor, a company might use a <strong>non-disclosure agreement (NDA)</strong> to ensure that all of this information remains private.</p>
<h2>Data Inventory and Retention</h2>
<p>If a company manufactures physical products, it typically maintains an inventory of those products. Similarly, data-centric organizations must also maintain a data inventory. A data inventory is essentially a comprehensive list of all the data collected and stored within an organization. This inventory includes essential details such as the owner of the data, how frequently the data is updated, and the format of the data.</p>
<p>To understand the privacy implications of this data inventory, it's crucial to have a clear picture of how the data is used. For example, data may be used for collaboration between different departments or projects, IT security may need access to it for protection purposes, and data quality checks might be performed to ensure accuracy and consistency.</p>
<p>When data is shared with third parties outside the organization, it is essential to comply with privacy laws and regulations. Therefore, understanding the data inventory helps identify what type of data is involved, how it is handled, and whether sharing it aligns with legal and regulatory requirements. By doing so, organizations ensure that they are compliant with privacy laws and protect the sensitive information of individuals and the company.</p></div>
