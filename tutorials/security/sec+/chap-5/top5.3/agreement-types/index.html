<h1>Agreement Types</h1>
<h3><strong>Service Level Agreement (SLA)</strong></h3>
<p>If you're working with a service provider, you may want to set certain requirements for <strong>uptime or availability</strong>, and you can integrate those requirements into a document called a <strong>Service Level Agreement (SLA)</strong>. This allows you to set <strong>minimum terms</strong> for the service provided by the third party.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
When entering into a contract with an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you might specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No more than <strong>4 hours of unscheduled downtime</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>technician must be dispatched</strong> during outages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spare equipment</strong> is to be kept on-site by the ISP</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these requirements can be written into the SLA so both parties clearly understand the expectations.</p>
<h3><strong>Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)</strong></h3>
<p>When starting a partnership with a third party, you might begin with a <strong>Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>MOUs outline <strong>broad goals</strong> of what the two organizations hope to accomplish</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May include <strong>confidentiality statements</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typically an <strong>informal</strong> document</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Not a signed contract</strong> and <strong>not legally enforceable</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It serves as a general overview of a potential partnership.</p>
<h3><strong>Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)</strong></h3>
<p>An <strong>MOA</strong> is a step above the MOU. It describes the relationship between two organizations <strong>in more detail</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>May include <strong>legally binding clauses</strong>, though it is <strong>generally not a formal contract</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clarifies how the two parties <strong>will work together</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>MOAs are more specific than MOUs, but still often lack full legal enforceability.</p>
<h3><strong>Master Service Agreement (MSA)</strong></h3>
<p>If you plan to have an ongoing relationship with a third party, a <strong>Master Service Agreement (MSA)</strong> is often used.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>formal legal contract</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sets <strong>terms and expectations</strong> for both parties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Used as a <strong>framework</strong> for future tasks or services</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
The MSA might outline:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Service terms</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Billing methods</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Payment schedules</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional services are added later without renegotiating the core agreement.</p>
<h3><strong>Statement of Work (SOW)</strong></h3>
<p>Used in conjunction with an MSA, the <strong>Statement of Work (SOW)</strong> defines <strong>specific tasks</strong>.</p>
<p>Includes details such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Scope of the job</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Job location</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deliverable schedule</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Expected outcomes</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SOWs ensure clarity and provide a point of reference if questions arise later about what was or wasnâ€™t completed.</p>
<h3><strong>Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)</strong></h3>
<p>To protect confidential information between two organizations, a <strong>Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)</strong> is used.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Allows parties to share <strong>trade secrets</strong> or <strong>business plans</strong> securely</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specifies what must remain <strong>confidential</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is a <strong>formal contract</strong> signed before sensitive discussions begin</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types of NDAs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unilateral NDA</strong>: Only one party must maintain confidentiality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bilateral/Mutual NDA</strong>: Both parties are required to maintain confidentiality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multilateral NDA</strong>: More than two parties are involved</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Business Partnership Agreement (BPA)</strong></h3>
<p>For formal partnerships, a <strong>Business Partnership Agreement (BPA)</strong> outlines the financial and operational structure.</p>
<p>Includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ownership stakes</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Decision-making authority</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Business operation details</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also outlines <strong>contingency plans</strong>, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens if <strong>financial disputes</strong> occur</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What to do if a <strong>disaster shuts down operations</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A BPA ensures both sides are prepared for both routine operations and unexpected events.</p></div>
