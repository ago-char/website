<h1>Security Awareness</h1>
<h2>Awareness on Phishing</h2>
<p>If you're working for a company and want to assess how many employees might fall for a <strong>phishing email</strong>, the best approach is to run an <strong>internal phishing campaign</strong>. This test simulates real-world phishing attempts and provides valuable insights into user behavior and the effectiveness of your security training.</p>
<p>The phishing campaign can be created <strong>in-house</strong> or through <strong>third-party vendors</strong> that specialize in these simulations. These tools typically track:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Email opens</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Link clicks</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Form submissions or other interactions</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When a user <strong>clicks on a simulated phishing link</strong>, they are immediately notified that the email was part of a test and that their action was incorrect. They’re often directed to <strong>additional training</strong>—either <strong>online modules</strong> or <strong>in-person sessions</strong>—to help reinforce proper security practices.</p>
<p>The primary goal is to <strong>educate users</strong> to recognize and report phishing emails. Key indicators include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Spelling and grammatical errors</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Suspicious or mismatched domain names</strong> in links</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unusual email formatting or structure</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unexpected attachments</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Requests for personal information or login credentials</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This exercise also serves as a <strong>test for your email security systems</strong>. If phishing simulations come from external sources, it’s a good opportunity to evaluate whether <strong>email filters and anti-spam tools</strong> are working correctly. Ideally, these filters should prevent phishing emails from reaching the user inbox.</p>
<p>To strengthen awareness, users should be trained to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid clicking links</strong> in emails unless they are certain of the source</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Never open attachments</strong> from unknown or suspicious senders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Report phishing attempts</strong> through a well-documented, easy-to-follow process (e.g., a dedicated "Report Phishing" button or email address)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By regularly conducting phishing simulations and reinforcing training, an organization can dramatically reduce the risk of a successful phishing attack and improve its overall <strong>security posture</strong>.</p>

<h2>Anomalous Behavior Recognition</h2>
<p>Not only are we monitoring for phishing attempts, but we’re also on the lookout for anything unusual happening on a user’s workstation. This is known as <strong>anomalous behavior recognition</strong>, and it plays a crucial role in detecting both malicious actions and human errors that could compromise security.</p>
<p>We begin by identifying <strong>risky behavior</strong>—actions that indicate a potential threat or policy violation. This can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A user or service <strong>modifying critical system files</strong>, such as the <code>hosts</code> file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Replacing or tampering</strong> with the core operating system files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unexpected file uploads</strong>, which might indicate data exfiltration or unauthorized data movement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also look for <strong>unexpected behavior</strong>, which typically signals something out of the ordinary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Logins from foreign or unusual locations</strong>, especially if they deviate from a user’s normal geographic pattern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sudden spikes in data transfers</strong> from a device, which could suggest data leakage or malware activity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we must recognize <strong>unintentional or accidental behavior</strong>, often caused by human error:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Typing an incorrect domain name</strong>, which could lead to unintended access attempts or phishing sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Misplacing a USB drive</strong>, which could result in data loss or exposure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Misconfigured security settings</strong> on a device, potentially reducing protection without the user realizing it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By monitoring for these behaviors—whether intentional, unintentional, or malicious—organizations can proactively detect threats, respond to incidents more effectively, and strengthen their overall security posture.</p>
<h2>Monitoring and Reporting</h2>
<p>A security team cannot effectively respond to threats without <strong>constant monitoring and automated reporting</strong> of key security events. This is why an <strong>auditing and alerting process</strong> is essential. Systems should be in place to automatically generate alerts when specific activities are detected and to compile <strong>daily reports</strong> with relevant security metrics.</p>
<p>These reports might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Phishing click rates</strong>, to track user susceptibility over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Password manager adoption</strong>, to measure secure credential storage practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) usage</strong>, to ensure critical systems are protected with layered access controls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other indicators of <strong>risky or anomalous behavior</strong>, such as failed login attempts or unusual file access patterns.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When a user clicks a phishing link or engages in another risky action for the first time, it should trigger <strong>targeted user training</strong>. The goal is to help the user understand the mistake and avoid repeating it.</p>
<p>Through continuous monitoring, security teams can identify <strong>recurring risky behavior</strong>, which may suggest the need for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Extended or personalized training</strong> for that user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adjustments to security settings</strong>, such as stricter access controls or data usage restrictions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This process ensures that users are not only educated but also that <strong>security measures evolve</strong> based on real-time behavior, leading to a more resilient and informed organizational security culture.</p>
<h2>Development and Execution of Security Plans</h2>
<p>The process of monitoring, reporting, and training users is typically handled by the <strong>security awareness team</strong>, a specialized unit within the IT or cybersecurity department focused on user behavior and education. This team plays a critical role in strengthening the human element of an organization's security posture.</p>
<p>The <strong>security awareness team</strong> is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Notifying the user community</strong> about emerging or ongoing security threats. This may involve sending <strong>emails</strong>, placing <strong>posters</strong> in common areas, or delivering <strong>mandatory training sessions</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Creating tailored training programs</strong> based on job roles, ensuring that employees receive relevant guidance. For instance, finance teams may be trained more rigorously on <strong>phishing related to invoice fraud</strong>, while IT staff may receive instruction on <strong>privilege misuse</strong> or <strong>system hardening</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Developing compliance-specific content</strong> when an organization is subject to regulations such as <strong>HIPAA, PCI-DSS, or GDPR</strong>. This ensures that users understand not just general threats, but also their <strong>legal responsibilities</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By using <strong>automated reporting systems</strong>, the security awareness team can generate <strong>detailed security metrics</strong>, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Training completion rates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduction in phishing link clicks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increases in secure behavior like MFA usage</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These metrics allow the team to <strong>measure progress</strong> over time and identify areas where further attention is needed. If specific departments or roles continue to show vulnerabilities, the team can <strong>refocus efforts</strong> to address those risks more directly. This <strong>data-driven approach</strong> ensures that security training is not only effective but continuously improving to meet evolving threats.</p>
<p>The <strong>security awareness team</strong> is responsible for developing and delivering <strong>IT security training materials</strong>, which may be presented through <strong>online platforms</strong> or <strong>in-person sessions</strong>. These materials are designed to educate users about potential threats, secure behavior, and the importance of adhering to organizational policies.</p>
<p>In addition to training, the team also generates <strong>detailed security metrics</strong> that are shared with other IT departments and <strong>key stakeholders</strong>, such as managers and executives. These metrics provide insight into how well current <strong>security controls</strong> are performing and whether <strong>user behavior is improving</strong> as a result of the awareness efforts.</p>
<p>These metrics might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Phishing test results</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training completion rates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incident reports tied to human error</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adoption rates of security tools like password managers or MFA</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stakeholders use this data to understand how security awareness impacts the <strong>organization’s overall risk posture</strong>. You'll often see the outcomes of these efforts in physical forms around the workplace, such as <strong>posters</strong>, <strong>flyers</strong>, or <strong>scheduled classroom training</strong>—all aimed at reinforcing good security practices.</p>
<p>Because the training programs are <strong>data-driven</strong>, the organization can directly <strong>correlate improvements in user behavior</strong> and <strong>reduced security incidents</strong> to the training initiatives. This feedback loop allows the security awareness team to continuously refine and tailor their efforts, ultimately contributing to a more secure organizational environment.</p></div>
