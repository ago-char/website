<h1>Security on Individual Interfaces for your Devices in the Network</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://study-ccna.com/port-security/">Port Security</a> refers to the security of individual interfaces of the devices you use or the devices that are in your network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are trying to connect to any wired or wireless network, if you are prompted for username and password, that is also one form of port security.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is the protocol or technology behind all the authentication process happening between you and device you are trying to connect to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not confined to one kind of device, it is developed to work on wired or wireless both systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manufactures can develop their own EAP methods based on this protocol and RFC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EAP integrates with IEEE 802.1X which is industry standard.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>IEEE 802.1X</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sometimes you may heard that it be called as <strong>Port-based Network Access Control (NAC)</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you were to plug in on available switch to be on the network, you will not be able to access the network until you are authenticated with NAC, which simply means you need username and password, and this database is managed by NAC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EAP integrates with NAC, also often they are used in conjunction with other auth databases like : RADIUS, LDAP, Kerberos, TACACS+, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Authentication Parties</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Supplicant</strong> - The client</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authenticator</strong> - The device that provides access</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authentication Server</strong> - Validates the client credentials</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
