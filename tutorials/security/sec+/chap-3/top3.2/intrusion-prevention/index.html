<h1>Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is designed to monitor the traffic that traverse the network at the real time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it sees any unwanted packet, pre definied signatures or sign of malware or or known vulnerabilities or  something dangerous  it will stop that from being executed even if firewall has allowed them for some reasons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may work with <strong>IDS</strong> that will alert <strong>IPS</strong> and it will block them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Failure Modes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We may configure many devices for security, but they can fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If fails occurs may be due to crash, hardware failure or etc. There can be :</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Fail</li>
<li>Close Fail</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This simple means either to pass on traffic when device fails (open fail) or not (close fail).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This depends on  the architecture of your network and how secure you want the environment be.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Active Monitoring</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>IPS</strong> focus on active monitoring. You may place the <strong>IPS</strong> as :</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/pics/active-monitoring.png" alt="active-monitoring.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Now this <strong>IPS</strong> is responsible to real time monitoring and prevent any malicious traffic. </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/pics/active-monitoring-example.png" alt="active-monitoring-example.png"></p>
<p>As you can see <span style="color:green;">GREEN</span> legit traffic is passed through firewall and IPS but the <span style="color:gray">GRAY</span> traffic eventhough passed through firewall is blocked on real time by <strong>IPS</strong> to reach onto switch.</p>
<h2>Passive Monitoring</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Real time traffic block may be the reason of downtime because it may be aggressive and blocking legitimate traffic also for some reasons. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this case, you may want to have different architecture. Insted of placing <strong>IPS</strong> in-line of the communication, you will like to put it behind the communication and send the copy of every packets received to monitor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There should be some mechanism <em>like in switch we have port mirror,</em> if it is not available we can set a network tap. This will help in duplicating and sending traffic to <strong>IPS</strong> for evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will not be on real time, so <strong>IPS</strong> just acts like <strong>IDS</strong>.
Example :</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/pics/passive-monitoring.png" alt="passive-monitoring.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>As seen switch is configured to send real time traffic to monitor in <strong>IPS</strong> but it is still reaching destination (That <span style="color:blue;">BLUE CIRCLE</span> ). This may not be best security practice but it may be necessity for particular situation or particular organization. </li>
</ul></div>
