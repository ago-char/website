<h1>VPN Concentrator</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/answer/How-does-the-VPN-concentrator-work">vpn conecntrator</a> is a dedicated device that you will connect to, from unsecure remote site to access the enterprise network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before, the connection may look like this :</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/pics/unsecure-conn-without-vpn.png" alt="unsecure-conn-without-vpn.png"></p>
<p>You are connecting from remote site to your server, which is not secure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now with the use of VPN concentrator :</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/pics/secure-conn-with-vpbn-concentrator.png" alt="secure-conn-with-vpbn-concentrator.png"></p>
<p>Now, you are connecting to your VPN concentrator which is responsible to enc/dec traffic.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As said, this could be dedicated purpose built standalone device, or may be integrated with firewalls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today, we often use Next Generation Firewalls, that will also provide the capabilities of this VPN concentrator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, we now have our Concentrator, but how would you connect to them ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Often Software based solution are availabe to connect to the VPN concentrator portal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How actually encryption happens</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>How are we able to encrypt all the data yet still find a way to send it across the internet hiding all of our information and send it across the vpn concentrator ?</em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A figure will help you clarify this :</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/pics/vpn-concentrator-packet-encryption.png" alt="vpn-concentrator-packet-encryption.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>The VPN concentrator often uses <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-ipsec/">ipsec protocol</a> to encrypt and decrypt traffic. Initially, the original traffic generated by application is now encrypted, as initial IP headers are encrypted, for routers to know where to reach, the IPsec will add new headers. When they reach destination, VPN concentrator will unwrap those Header and Trailer, also decrypt the encrypted part and forward to dedicated destination.</li>
</ul>
<h1>SSL/TLS VPN</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is one of the medium to connect back to the VPN Concentrator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uses ssl/tls, the same protocol to communicate and encrypt web sever traffifc, so generally bypassed by the firewall. This means no additional rules need to be defined at firewall level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No big VPN clients or multi-clients are connected, generally single client connecting to the vpn provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Often software installed on mobile devices (nord vpn, hma etc., or propriteory level) that connect to vpn server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also integrated within os.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Normally authenticated with simple login username and password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are not forced to  use shared passwords as in ipsec or some digital signs or certs, but we may have to capability to use them which depends on our vpn software provider and the security infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also VPN available for browsers, that will enc/dec traffic within browsers but not outside them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SSL vpns can be set as <strong>always on</strong>, this will ensure that whenever we are sending traffic or receiving, that is always in the encrypted tunnel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See: </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/pics/ssl-tls-vpn.png" alt="ssl-tls-vpn.png"></p>
<h1>Site to Site VPN</h1>
<ul>
<li>Prebuilt infrastructure for corporate organization.</li>
<li>This means each branch is configured to use VPN concentrator that is required to talk to any other branch.</li>
<li>No additional software is required on client, the process happens automatically. This can be clarified with the diagram below :</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/pics/site-site-vpn.png" alt="site-site-vpn.png"></p>
<h1>SD-WAN</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><img src="/pics/old-wan-structure.png" alt="old-wan-structure.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is  the old WAN architecture, where every remote branch or site will connect to the Data Center of the company, and then that Data Center will forward the traffic to provide the appropriate response that is asked by the site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today, with everything are gradually shifting toward cloud, and the topology becomes :</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/pics/wan-cloud.png" alt="wan-cloud.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As, things are gone to the cloud, to get secure connection, we are now required to connect to the data center, and data center will then connect back to the cloud and gets the information to provide us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is loss in network bandwidth, jitter, latency, etc. with this approach. Because to get the resource availabe at the cloud, we are (unnecessarily) visiting our data center for security.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>SD-WAN Architecture</h2>
<p><img src="/pics/sd-wan-architecture.webp" alt="sd-wan-architecture.webp"></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/what-is/sd-wan.html">sd wan</a> designes network in such a way that, it will connect back to data center only when necessary. Different rules, paths, ACLs are deployed to achieve this.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Secure Access Service Edge</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Now that we have a way to connect to cloud and data center in network efficient way, thanks to SD-WAN, <strong>How will me maintain the secure Infrastructure ?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will now use <strong><a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-sase">SASE</a></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alongwith the services are shifted to cloud, security is too. And the security will be very close or next to the services we are trying to render.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can think SASE as our Next Generation VPN with a lot of capabilities like :</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/pics/SASE-model.png" alt="SASE-model.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Now that each users will be configured to use SASE, they will first connect to SASE which is capable of providing all the necessary functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After connection to SASE, user then can jump over the services required.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Problem of Choice</h1>
<ul>
<li>As security and technology and services are growing deep and vast, the administrator has challenge to implement different structure of security. Depending on need, budget and architecture, he may address one or all form listed below in the diagram :</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/pics/problem-of-choice.png" alt="problem-of-choice.png"></p>
<p>So, for example : he may choose SSL VPN for user access (work from home), but this is not efficient if the organization has multiple sites, now Ipsec Tunnels is required to connect them. As organization shifted on cloud, traditional WAN be replaced with SD-WAN which is great but does not have adequate security mechanisms and to achive this he may have to implement SASE.</p></div>
