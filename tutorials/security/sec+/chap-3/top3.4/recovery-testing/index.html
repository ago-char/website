<h1>Recovery Testing</h1>
<p>You may have defined your way for resilience and plan your capacity, but you also need to test if they will work if something were to happen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's not "if" happens, it's often "when" happens</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Testing should be done in confined manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None of testing activity should affect any kind of production activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Often, extra time or off day training is organized for this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tabletop Exercise</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is almost impossible to shilf every employee, infrastructure to shift in testing environment specially in large organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As, it is hard to create exact recovery state, <a href="https://uwpd.wisc.edu/content/uploads/2014/01/What_is_a_tabletop_exercise.pdf">tabletop exercise</a>, is nice approach for at least giving all the stakeholders idea and knowledge about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the exercise, it is assumed that situation has arrived, individuals will be tasked to perform in specific time and analysis the result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The best way of perfoming this exercise, is to <em>talk through</em> it or organize virtual presentation class.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Simulation</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You should simulate the exact training cross check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may have provide training on phising, so to cross check, org should conduct this program of sending phising campaign invisible to employees and evaluate the result.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If to check the system can recover from <em>fail over</em>, you should perform exercise like turning off the original server and check if it could re catch the secondary one. This should be done in testing, outside the production environment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Parallel Processing</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This may not be the best way but using multiple core or multiple cpus for parallel processing also handels recovery in certain way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a core of cpu fails, still some other cores will be able to perform intended task, even slowness occur, <em>something is better than nothing</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
