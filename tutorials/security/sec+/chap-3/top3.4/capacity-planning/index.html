<h1>Capacity Planning</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is always a difficult task to predict the Demand-Supply. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If demand is high and you are not able to supply on time, this will affect your revenue and potentially cause outage.        </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And if the supply is high, you are paying more than you need to, so will directly affect your future capacity and profit also.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So, while designing your platform or company, you will need to design in flexible way.</strong></p>
<h2>Technology Engineering</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Before designing, you will need such a plan in technology building which must be scalable. Not all type of technology can scale, so be careful while designing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may initially wanna use <code>load balancers</code> for your servers, <code>culster</code> your servers or <code>array</code> your storage. So that you can easily add or remove any computers behind the scene without end user noticing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are using cloud, you may wanna use load balancers there too or use multiple on demand cloud providers' services, instead of using static.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Underlying Infrastructure</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You should be aware of what online or offline platform to choose, this means if to use physical site or to build on cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As, building site physical required people, equipments, location, building, etc. this may not be scalable now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But also, you may not want to put everything online specifically those which are secret or private for your own company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, you design for internal use be at physical near your office, but for your clients or end user, things and app may be deployed online on cloud.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Employees or People</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They are tough to handle with flexibility and scability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may need to hire or fire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For hiring, you require additional process of recruiment, tranning, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you fire, you may gain "revenue of paying them", but may lose "their knowledge that your training had provided". So, it always challenging.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
