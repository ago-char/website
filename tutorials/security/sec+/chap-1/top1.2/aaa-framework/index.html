<h1>AAA for Systems</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How would you verify if certain system(device) is allowed on your network. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A system certainly can not type password to verify itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, how can you truely AUTHENTICATE a device ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will put a digitally signed certificate on the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And other business process can rely on the certificate for access, creating rules, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Authentication</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most organizations will have their own <strong>Certificate Authority (CA)</strong>, which will even has its own Certificate signed by <strong>Root CA</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The organization will create a certificate for the device and digitally signs the certificate with the organization's <strong>CA</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, basically, on a controlled environment, organization itself is responsible for including (putting) that cert in the device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever, the device will want to on the network or access something on the network, this cert can be used as a factor of <em>Authorization</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actually, the <strong>CA</strong> digital signature is used to validate the certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pictorically,<br />

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Authorization</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Now the system has been authenticated, you should provide access to certain data, apps and resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A way of doing it is to map <em>User -&gt; Data</em>, but imagine 1000s of users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In such situation, you will often create <strong>An Abstraction</strong> to <strong>Authorization Model</strong>, so the mapping will look like <em>Users -&gt; Group(s) -&gt; Data, Apps, Services</em> , this made scaling pretty esay.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accounting</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You will need to keep log of :</p>
<ol>
<li>Login</li>
<li>Activities (Normal - Critical)</li>
<li>Accessed Resources</li>
<li>Logout</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log in such a formatted way (date, time, detail, level, etc.), so that it will help analysis team in case of study.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
