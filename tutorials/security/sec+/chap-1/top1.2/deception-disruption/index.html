<p>These are the techniques to convience  or lure the attacker that they are attacking the real vulnerable system while the system is virtual. This is actually way to keep attacker busy, making the attack system more complex as they enter different layers. It is done to know different tools, technologies and techniques attackers are using to gain access to your environment and build policies regarding those.</p>
<h1>Honeypot</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attrack the <em>threat actors/bad guys</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a virtual world for attacker (alike to your world) not connected to production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Constant battle to discere the real from fake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As attacker get better identifying honeypot, we increase the complexity and intelligene.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not uncommon to combine all these <strong>honeypots</strong> into much larger infrastructure: </p>
<h1>Honeynets</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If <strong>Server</strong> is the point of attraction  or <strong>honeypot</strong> for attacker, the full system of <strong>Servers, Workstations, Routers, Switches, Firewalls</strong> could be <strong>Honeynet</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that you have created <strong>Honeynet</strong>, it will be much more realistic and believeable enviornment and hopefully you will be able to keep attackers busy in this illusion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Honeyfiles</h1>
<ul>
<li>You can also place some looking important files like : <code>pass.dat</code> that may lure attacker inside your <strong>honeynet</strong> or <strong>honeypot</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You could go further and get some info about attacker posting :</p>
<h1>Honeytokens</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You could place fake <em>API Credentials, Email Address, DB records, Cookies</em>, etc. As a result if you see these info somewhere on the other side of the internet, you might be able to see where might the attack is comming from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might alert or log when these <em>honeytokens</em> are accessed or grabbed, so you may see it on realtime or at the time of analysis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
