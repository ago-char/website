<h1>Blockchain Technology</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A distributed ledger to keep track of transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Available to anyone to see ( a way to verify the data ).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone participating in blockchain can maintain the ledger and all will have the copy of this ledger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once changes is done in ledger, will be distributed to all the users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Use</h1>
<p>We can use this technology in anything we will require to keep track of transactions which could be :
- Payment Processing
- Digital Identification
- Supply Chain Monitoring
- Digital Voting</p>
<h1>Procedure</h1>
<p>Let's take an example of banking transaction :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Members of blockchain : Bank Branches, Sender, Receiver
Say <em>Sender</em> sent money to <em>Receiver</em>, instead of sending or keeping the copy of the result of this transaction only to <em>Sender and Receiver</em>, all the members will be forwared this ledger so that they could keep track of this info coz they are stakeholders and members. This will help in syncronization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members : Malpot, all government institute
If A is to sell his property to B, instead of keeping record only in Malpot, the copy is sent to all the members, so that whenever government has to verify if the property belongs to which individual, it could perform within any agency, not only Malpot.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Process</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each ledger of transaction will be added into large group of ledger after receiving copy and will ultimately processed by the Blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Hashes</em> are very important as many participents has the copy of this transaction, <em>Hash</em> is only the way to know if info has been modified, if it has been it will not be stored and will be thrown out of the blockchain or update it.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
