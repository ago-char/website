<h1>Static IP over Wifi</h1>
<p>Let me remind you, this is just a cheetsheet for pros. Maybe <a href="https://www.linuxbabe.com/command-line/ubuntu-server-16-04-wifi-wpa-supplicant">linuxbabe has given enough detail for you.</a></p>
<p>If you are running headless server in Raspberry pi or any linux box, you may have encounter problem on setting static ip (that does not change over reboot) as there are different network related services are running and maybe they conflicts eachother.</p>
<p>Well, if you are using heavy server like ubuntu then, of course <code>NetworkManager</code> does all the hardwork for you, but for headless server for simple home automation or home network management or even small office server, it is not feasible to use <code>NetworkManager</code>, especially in raspberry Pi, I found that it has even problem on auto connect and interface often goes down idk why.</p>
<p>But, there is a solution. You sould use <code>wpa_supplicant</code> along with <code>dhcpcd</code>. The main reason, I am writing this blog because I was setting pi-home then, as it is headless, I only have option to ssh it. The interface goes down often. I was using <code>nmcli</code> to connect and modify often and often, connecting temporariry with monitor, this annoys. </p>
<p>Hence, over searching the internet offers following solutions :</p>
<h2>Stopping and Disabling NetworkManager</h2>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager &amp;&amp; sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager
</code></pre>
<h2>Creating wpa_supplicant config</h2>
<p>Most of the linux systems are already using it. If not, install. I asume you had it. The configuration file resites at <code>/etc/wpa_supplicant</code>. Let's populate it :</p>
<pre><code>wpa_passphrase wifi_name wifi_password | sudo tee /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Basically this saves wifi SSID and Password, in the format that <code>wpa_supplicant</code> understands. You can use another wifi  also, if you have multiple.</p>
<pre><code>wpa_passphrase wifi2 pass-for-wifi2 | sudo tee -a /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Remember to use <code>-a</code> for <code>tee</code>, to append this record to previous. Having multiple record means, as <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/5/wpa_supplicant.conf">man page</a> says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Configuration file can include one or more network blocks, e.g., one for each used SSID. wpa_supplicant will automatically select the best network based on the order of network blocks in the configuration file, network security level (WPA/WPA2 is preferred), and signal strength.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note, just in case you could not find your AP name :</p>
<pre><code>#Scan for any APs avl
sudo iw wlan0 scan | grep SSID
</code></pre>
<h2>Edit wpa_supplicant service</h2>
<p>It is better to copy <code>/lib/systemd/system/wpa_supplicant.service</code> at <code>/etc/systemd/system/</code> so that newer changes doesnot reflect our ability to get the static ip address, and populate the copied file to be following content :</p>
<pre><code># /etc/systemd/system/wpa_supplicant.service
[Unit]
Description=WPA supplicant
Before=network.target
After=dbus.service
Wants=network.target
IgnoreOnIsolate=true

[Service]
Type=dbus
BusName=fi.w1.wpa_supplicant1
ExecStart=/sbin/wpa_supplicant -u -s -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -i wlan0
Restart=always
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
Group=netdev
RuntimeDirectory=wpa_supplicant
RuntimeDirectoryMode=0750

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Alias=dbus-fi.w1.wpa_supplicant1.service

</code></pre>
<p>Pay attention to <code>ExecStart</code>, that is the file, we have set up with two SSIDs. The <code>Restart=alway</code> ensures, if it fail, without user knowing, the service will be restarted.</p>
<h2>Use of dhcpcd</h2>
<p>Once done, install <code>sudo apt install dhcpcd</code>, and append <code>/etc/dhcpcd.conf</code> as :</p>
<pre><code># staic ip addr for wlan0
interface wlan0
static ip_address=192.168.1.180/24
static routers=192.168.1.254
static domain_name_servers=192.168.1.180 1.1.1.3

</code></pre>
<p>One thing to understand is that,  you always does not have your interface name be <code>wlan0</code>. So you may find your wifi interface with :</p>
<pre><code>iw dev
</code></pre>
<p>Ensure it has connected to any wifi mentioned in <code>wpa_suppliant.conf</code> :</p>
<pre><code>iw dev wlan0 link
Not connected
</code></pre>
<p>If you get <strong>Not connected</strong>,  that is fine, restart the <code>wpa_supplicant</code>.</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl restart wpa_supplicant
</code></pre>
<p>verify with <code>ip a show wlan0</code>, you should got your ip address :</p>
<pre><code>ip a show wlan0
&lt;snip&gt;
inet 192.168.1.180/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global noprefixroute wlan0
&lt;snip&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You should try <code>sudo reboot</code> to check if it persists.</p></div>
